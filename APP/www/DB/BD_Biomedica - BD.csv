Lately, technological systems for human motion analysis have been used in clinics to identify abnormal movement states, while they generally suffer from privacy challenges and concerns especially at home or in remote places. This paper presents a novel privacy preservation and quantification methodology that imitates the forgetting process of human memory to protect privacy in patient-centric healthcare. The privacy preservation principle of this methodology is to change the traditional data analytic routines into a distributed and disposable form (i.e., DnD) so as to naturally minimise the disclosure of patients’ health data. To help judge the efficacy of DnD-based privacy preservation, the researchers further developed a risk-driven privacy quantification framework to supplement the existing privacy quantification techniques. To facilitate validating the methodology, this research also involves a home-care-oriented movement analysis system that comprises a single inertial measurement sensor and a mobile application. The system can acquire personal information, raw data of movements and indexes to evaluate the risk of falls and gait at homes. Moreover, the researchers conducted a technological appreciation survey of 16 health professionals to help understand the perception of this research. The survey obtains positive feedback regarding the movement analysis system and the proposed methodology as suitable for home-care scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.

There is a need for small flexible touch sensors with high accuracy and sensitivity for this type of device. Touch sensors in prosthetic devices are needed for feedback mechanisms to the user and to achieve high dexterity in control schemes for fragile objects. A brief review of prosthetic touch sensors is presented, addressing desirable characteristics for touch sensing. In this paper, a custom shape flexible capacitive touch sensor is designed and characterized, meeting prosthetic sensors needs, such as thickness, power consumption, accuracy, repeatability, and stability. The designed sensor presented the capability to distinguish up to 0.5N steps with good stability. The sensor accomplished a full sensing range between 5N and 100N with reasonable accuracy, and hysteresis analysis achieved an average of 8.8 %. Clinical Relevance- The custom shape capacitive sensors proposed in this paper contribute to the development of tactile sensors for prosthetic devices as more accurate and sensitive sensor interfaces are required to detect and improve manipulating capabilities. © 2022 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

Ltda, Santiago, 7980265, Chile;Vibratory screens are used in mining to classify mineral and send it to different pathways, normally using conveyor belts. Vibration analysis techniques are commonly used for condition monitoring and early detection of unforeseen failures to generate predictive maintenance. This paper proposes a novel solution to implement wireless sensors forming an instrumentation dedicated network combined with data-driven machine learning for monitoring vibrating screens. The system is optimized explicitly for vibratory equipment, which sets it apart from general-purpose condition monitoring systems. Embedded sensors are battery-powered and robust to withstand constant vibratory movement. The data used for training the machine learning models are gathered from a lab setup and discrete element simulations. The test bench consisted of a lab-scale vibratory screener, in which 3-axis accelerations, cumulative damage and wear are measured using sensors embedded in the rubber screens. Proposed data-driven machine learning models classify each screen condition in states according to the ISO 2372 standards for vibration severity. The system can identify random failures (based on test bench measured data) as progressive degradation failures over time (based on discrete element methods simulation results). The accuracy of the classification algorithms consistently ranges from 95% to 98%. Moreover, the system allows the early detection of unacceptable states up to 168 hours before the screen's end-of-life predation by an expert. The system is characterized for (i) avoiding unplanned downtime and consequently (ii) increase operational availability. The system is intended to notify users when an abnormal operation is detected and impending failure events in the early stage. © 2013 IEEE.;-;English;Article

In this work, a computational model combining FEM and MRG axon models is implemented to replicate two experimental studies that compare the effect of changing inter-electrode distance when applying FES to induce knee flexion. One work affirms that the stronger torque happens for greater distances, while the other obtain its maximum at lower distances. Using a simplified computational model gave another study perspective to understand why these two stimulation methodologies obtain different results. According to our results, an anodic stimulation occurs with greater current intensities and inter-electrode distances. This anodic effect can activate other nerve or motor points in the vicinity of the anode, explaining that more muscle fibers are recruited and generate an increased torque. Clinical Relevance - This work gives another view to understanding how the distance between electrodes affects neural activation, which has implications for optimizing clinical and exercise protocols using electrical stimulation techniques. © 2022 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

Reusable respirators include filters that protect workers against harmful dust, smoke, gases, and vapors. These hazards may cause cancer, lung impairment, and diseases. Respiratory protection is prone to failure or misuse, such as wearing respirators with filters out of service life and employees wearing respirators loosely. Currently, there are no commercial systems capable of reliably alerting of misuse of respiratory protective equipment during the workday shifts or provide early information about dangerous clogging levels of filters. This paper proposes a low energy and non-obtrusive functional building block with embedded electronics that enable breathing monitoring inside an industrial reusable respirator. The embedded electronic device collects multidimensional data from an integrated pressure, temperature, and relative humidity sensor inside a reusable industrial respirator in real time and sends it wirelessly to an external platform for further processing. Here, the calculation of instantaneous breathing rate and estimation of the filter's respirator fitting and clogging level is performed. The device was tested with ten healthy subjects in laboratory trials. The subjects were asked to wear industrial reusable respirator with the embedded electronic device attached inside. The signals measured with the system were compared with airflow signals measured with calibrated transducers for validation purposes. The correlation between the estimated breathing rates using pressure, temperature, and relative humidity with the reference signal (airflow) is 0.987, 0.988 and 0.989 respectively, showing that instantaneous breathing rate can be calculated accurately using the information from the embedded device. Moreover, respirator fitting (well-fitted or loose condition) and filter's clogging levels (≤60%, 80% and 100% clogging) also can be estimated using features extracted from absolute pressure measurements combined to statistical analysis ANOVA models. These experimental outputs represent promising results for further development of data-driven prediction models using machine learning techniques to determine filters end-of-service life. Furthermore, the proposed system would collect relevant data for real-time monitoring of workers' breathing conditions and respirator usage, helping to improve occupational safety and health in the workplace.;-;English;Article

The challenge is to choose the ideal systems that suit the studies. One possibility is to measure the interaction of the sole and the support surface and detect gait events related to the positioning of the foot. This work proposes a gait subphase classification based on Hidden Markov Model that identifies gait stance subphases from a foot pressure measurement. A sensorized insole was used to record the pressure under the foot with eight custom-made capacitive sensors. Tests were performed on six volunteers with a 10-meter trial test. Mean cadence and stance/swing ratio were calculated. These parameters match the normal range for the age of the volunteers found in the literature. The results show that the proposed model can classify the gait in 5 subphases using the Center of Pressure (CoP) anteroposterior position and velocity as input. Changes in the slope of the CoP marks the step between subphases. Clinical Relevance - Most gait studies are performed in highly equipped gait laboratories. Due to technical requirements and the high cost of implementing a gait laboratory, access to these services is difficult for a large population. For this reason, it is necessary to develop equipment, devices, and algorithm to further study pathological and healthy gait. © 2022 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

Electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves using invasive electrodes has shown promise in maintaining diaphragm condition by inducing intermittent diaphragm muscle contraction. However, the widespread application of these methods may be limited by their risks as well as the technical and environmental requirements of placement and care. Non-invasive stimulation would offer a valuable alternative method to maintain diaphragm health while overcoming these limitations. Methods: We applied non-invasive electrical stimulation to the phrenic nerve in the neck in healthy volunteers. Respiratory pressure and flow, diaphragm electromyography and mechanomyography, and ultrasound visualization were used to assess the diaphragmatic response to stimulation. The electrode positions and stimulation parameters were systematically varied in order to investigate the influence of these parameters on the ability to induce diaphragm contraction with non-invasive stimulation. Results: We demonstrate that non-invasive capture of the phrenic nerve is feasible using surface electrodes without the application of pressure, and characterize the stimulation parameters required to achieve therapeutic diaphragm contractions in healthy volunteers. We show that an optimal electrode position for phrenic nerve capture can be identified and that this position does not vary as head orientation is changed. The stimulation parameters required to produce a diaphragm response at this site are characterized and we show that burst stimulation above the activation threshold reliably produces diaphragm contractions sufficient to drive an inspired volume of over 600 ml, indicating the ability to produce significant diaphragmatic work using non-invasive stimulation. Conclusion: This opens the possibility of non-invasive systems, requiring minimal specialist skills to set up, for maintaining diaphragm function in the intensive care setting. © 2022 The Authors.

Usually, gait is evaluated through observation and clinical assessment scales to identify the state and deterioration of the patient's postural control. Lately, technological systems for bio-mechanical analysis have been used to determine abnormal gait states being expensive, difficult to use, and impossible to apply in real conditions. In this article, we explore the ability of a system based on a single inertial measurement unit located in the lower back to estimate spatio-temporal gait parameters by analyzing the signals available in the Physionet repository 'Long Term Movement Monitoring Database' which, together with automatic classification algorithms, allow predicting the risk of falls in the elderly population. Different classification algorithms were trained and evaluated, being the Support Vector Machine classifier with a third-degree polynomial kernel, cost function C = 2 with the best performance, with an Accuracy = 59%, Recall = 91%, and F1- score = 71%, providing promising results regarding a proposal for the quantitative, online and realistic evaluation of gait during activities of daily living, which is where falls actually occur in the target population. Clinical Relevance - This work proposes an early risk of falls detection tool, essential to start preventive treatment strategies to maintain the independence of the elderly through a non-invasive, simple, and low-cost alternative. © 2022 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

For years, researchers have tried to find out which tasks and measures provide optimal detection of balance disorders, so that they can be quantified. This paper proposes the use of an accelerometer sensor located in the lower back to measure the center of mass accelerations and to characterize the subject's static balance. For characterizing the static balance objectively, we propose using normality circles, a centroid, and a dispersion circle during the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (mCTSIB) test. The proposed methodology was tested using two groups of subjects (10 healthy and 3 unhealthy). Our methodology for the static balance was compared to the Berg Balance Scale score. The results shown that a subject with lower BBS score obtain lower dispersion circle and is outside the normality circle. Also, our method outperforms a new option since it characterizes the static balance in an objective, portable, simple, and low-cost way. Clinical Relevance - Our proposed methodology to characterize the static balance can help to simplify objectify and reduce the cost of the clinical practice for balance evaluation. © 2022 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

According to the World Health Organization, fifteen million people suffer a stroke per year, and one of three people's survival gets drop foot. Functional Electrical Stimulation systems are applied over the peroneal motor nerve to achieve the drop foot problem's dorsiflexion. An accurate and reliable way to identify in real-time the gait phases to trigger and finish the stimulation is needed. This paper proposes a new step sensor with a custom capacitive pressure sensors array located under the heel to detect a gait pattern in real-time to synchronize the stimulation with the user gait. The step sensor uses a capacitive pressure sensors array and hardware, which acquire the signals, execute an algorithm to detect the start and finish of the swing phase in real-time, and send the synchronization signal wirelessly. The step sensor was tested in two ways: 10 meters walk test and walking in a treadmill for 2 minutes. These two tests were performed with two different walk velocities and with thirteen healthy volunteers. Thus, all the 1342 steps were correctly detected. Compared to an inertial sensor located in the lower-back, the proposed step sensor achieves a mean error of 27.60±0.03 [ms] for the detection of the start of the swing phase and a mean error of 20.86±0.02 [ms] for the detection of the end of the swing phase. The results show an improvement in time error (respect to others pressure step sensors), sensibility and specificity (both 100%), and comfortability. © 2001-2011 IEEE.;Drops- Errors- Functional electric stimulation- Partial pressure sensors- Pressure sensors- Sensor arrays- Capacitive pressure sensors- Clinical conditions- Functional electri-cal stimulations- Functional electrical stimulators- Healthy volunteers- Inertial sensor- Synchronization signals- World Health Organization- Capacitive sensors- acceleration- accelerometry- adult- algorithm- Article- artificial neural network- electrostimulation- error- female- functional electrical stimulation- gait- heel- human- human experiment- male- normal human- reproducibility- sensibility- training- walk test- walking- walking speed- electrotherapy- neurologic gait disorder- Electric Stimulation Therapy- Gait- Gait Disorders, Neurologic- Heel- Humans- Walking;English;Article

It provides relevant information on the condition of a patient’s pathologies. In the last decades, different gait measurement methods have been developed in order to identify parameters that can contribute to gait cycles. Analyzing those parameters, it is possible to segment and identify different phases of gait cycles, making these studies easier and more accurate. This paper proposes a simple gait segmentation method based on plantar pressure measurement. Current methods used by researchers and clinicians are based on multiple sensing devices (e.g., multiple cameras, multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs)). Our proposal uses plantar pressure information from only two sensorized insoles that were designed and implemented with eight custom-made flexible capacitive sensors. An algorithm was implemented to calculate gait parameters and segment gait cycle phases and subphases. Functional tests were performed in six healthy volunteers in a 10 m walking test. The designed in-shoe insole presented an average power consumption of 44 mA under operation. The system segmented the gait phases and sub-phases in all subjects. The calculated percentile distribution between stance phase time and swing phase time was almost 60%/40%, which is aligned with literature reports on healthy subjects. Our results show that the system achieves a successful segmentation of gait phases and subphases, is capable of reporting COP velocity, double support time, cadence, stance phase time percentage, swing phase time percentage, and double support time percentage. The proposed system allows for the simplification of the assessment method in the recovery process for both patients and clinicians. © 2020 by the authors.

The strong light-matter interaction and impressive performance achieved by tuning the optical/electrical properties have enabled them as potential candidates for optoelectronic applications. In this perspective, we report the synthesis of metal-halide perovskite nanocomposites by incorporation of graphene sheets into the perovskite framework, which exhibits a significant enhancement in electro-optic (E-O) switching modulation. The carrier dynamics in the nanocomposite is investigated using time-resolved luminescence and broadband dielectric spectroscopy studies to get insights into the carrier relaxation and transfer mechanisms. The presence of graphene in the perovskite nanocomposites induced dielectric polarization with a strong electrical conduction and a nonlinear dielectric behavior with negative permittivity at the percolation threshold concentration because of the large resonance derived from the plasmonic oscillations of delocalized charges.

As a consequence of this, there has been poor massification of motion measurement technologies that are both objective and reliable in nature. Advances about the study of gait and its interpretation in recent years using inertial sensors have allowed proposing acceptable alternatives for the development of portable and low-cost systems that contribute to people's health in places and institutions that cannot acquire or maintain the operation of commercially available systems. A system based on a custom single Inertial Measurement Unit and a mobile application is proposed. Thus, an investigation is carried out using methodologies and algorithms found in the literature in order to get the main gait events and the spatial-temporal gait parameters. Twenty healthy Chilean subjects were assessed using a motion capture system simultaneously with the proposed tool. The results show that it is possible to estimate temporal gait parameters with slight differences respect gold-standard. We reach maximum mean differences of -2.35±5.02[step/min] for cadence, 0.03±0.04[sec] for stride time,0.02±0.03[sec] for step time, ±0.02[sec] for a single support time, 0.01±0.02[sec] for double support time and 0.01±0.03[m] for step length. As a result of experimental findings, we propose a new technological tool that can perform gait analysis. Our proposed system is user-friendly, low-cost, and portable. Therefore, we suggest that it could be an attractive technological tool that healthcare professionals could harness to objectively measure gait in environments that are either within the community or controlled. We also suggest that the tool could be used in countries where advanced clinical tools cannot be acquired. Therefore, we propose in this paper that our system is an attractive, alternative system that can be used for gait analysis by health professionals worldwide. © 2020 Ivyspring International Publisher.

The triple intercell bar technology with current-source topology is an alternative solution. The bar overcomes faulty or open contacts with sidebars and faces the challenge of metallurgical short circuits providing short circuit resistance. In addition, thanks to the lower dispersion of current densities obtained by the technology, an increase in sunlight energy of + 10% becomes possible. The better dispersion allows modulating the energy consumption of 300, 000 tons of copper cathodes per year facility. A concentrated parameter model using industrial data projects the results. The technology ensures that all defective contacts are bypassed and, the short circuits avoided or eliminated. Furthermore, the lifetime of the electrodes is extended and the energy efficiency improved. A conservative estimate is an annual saving in electricity costs of US$ 2.4 million and in electrodes of US$ 0.8 million. The inclusion of photovoltaic modulated energy brings additional savings of US$ 12.9 million. © 2019 IEEE.;Copper- Copper metallurgy- Cost benefit analysis- Dispersions- Electric resistance- Electrodes- Electrowinning- Energy efficiency- Energy management- Energy utilization- Advanced technology- Alternative solutions- Circuit resistance- Copper electrowinning- Current-source topology- Defective contacts- Photovoltaic energy- Short circuit control- Costs;English;Conference Paper

According to the literature, the vestibular system associated with balance decreases its accuracy over the years and, along with other degenerative diseases associated with aging, causes severe falls that can lead to death. Several tests have been proposed to measure the balance. Most of these are clinical tests based on an expert's subjective opinion, which lacks objectivity. In this work, we present a system to measure balance based on data obtained from accelerometers and quaternions. These measurements allow us to analyze the acceleration and drawing representing balance. 24 healthy subjects were measured and analyzed with our system, and the corresponding results are presented. © 2019 IEEE.;Clinical tests- Daily activity- Degenerative disease- Healthy subjects- Inertial sensor- Posture- Sensory interactions- Vestibular system- Inertial navigation systems;English;Conference Paper

The Timed Up & Go test (TU & Go) is the most used tool to measure this risk of falling, which offers a unique parameter in seconds that represents the dynamic balance. However, it is not determined in which activity the subject presents greater difficulties. For this, a feature-based segmentation method using a single wireless Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is proposed in order to analyze data of the inertial sensors to provide a complete report on risks of falls. Twenty-five young subjects and 12 older adults were measured to validate the method proposed with an IMU in the back and with video recording. The measurement system showed similar data compared to the conventional test video recorded, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9884 and a mean error of 0.17 ± 0.13 s for young subjects, as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.9878 and a mean error of 0.2 ± 0.22 s for older adults. Our methodology allows for identifying all the TU & Go sub–tasks with a single IMU automatically providing information about variables such as: duration of sub–tasks, standing and sitting accelerations, rotation velocity of turning, number of steps during walking and turns, and the inclination degrees of the trunk during standing and sitting. © 2019 by the authors.

With this segmented intercell configuration the resilience to anomalies is improved by reducing short-circuit occurrence and their magnitude. Anomalies are pinpointed in 60 s with the addition of light mass secondary connectors placed on the capping board. Moreover, the new topology is capable of surpassing anomalies even without assistance to sustain production.

For 9 hours, the highly irradiated desert of Chile produces PV at half the price compared to that generated from fossil fuels. A major challenge for the mining industry is to take advantage of it. However, the design concept for the equipment was to operate with carbon-based energy 24-hour flat-price. Moreover, since electrical energy used to be more expensive, these plants operate with small inter-electrode distances to reduce electrical consumption. They also require oil-heated exchangers to supplement the electrolyte heat required by the process. Now, during the 9 hour low PV price scenario a larger process current should be enough for electrolyte heating. To complement the heat required a solution is remove some electrodes per cell. Results indicate that the heat storage capacity of the electrolyte is enough to keep a semi-constant temperature throughout the day. Moreover, there are various advantages of larger electrode spacing: higher short circuit impedance, lower cathode-currents dispersion and, lower sensitivity to electrode misalignments and contact resistances dispersion. A 3D FEM fed with industrial data predicts the results. A discussion of the positive-negative effects on the copper deposit current efficiency and energy consumption is included. Finally as an example, the paper calculates the inter-electrode distance required to eliminate the oil-heated external exchanger for a copper cathode electro winning plant of 240,000 tons / year. © 2018 IEEE.;Cathodes- Copper deposits- Digital storage- Dispersions- Energy utilization- Finite element method- Fossil fuels- Heat storage- Constant temperature- Copper electrowinning- Electrical consumption- Electrode distances- Electrode spacing- Electrolyte heating- Heat storage capacity- Short-circuit impedance- Electrolytes;English;Conference Paper

The electrochemical kinetics of cells is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition allows enhancing cathode quality, electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, early identification of temperature excursions, and electrolyte flow blockages. Abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation, higher energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, and safety issues because the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations. With real-time information about electrolyte variables, it is possible to provide early warnings to face the wide variability of cell performance and safety conditions caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a noninvasive wireless sensor for monitoring the electrolyte temperature inside cells and estimates the electrolyte circulation flow through each cell simultaneously. The sensor design is suitable to highly corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition-monitoring sensor proposed is small in size, lightweight, and meets battery-free operation and nonsparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a radio frequency-link for communicating.

Currently, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness of belt conveyors (availability, utilization & load-factor) is a major concern for mining operators. The downtime of overland conveyors leads to the stoppage of bulk material handling, disrupting ore extraction and material processing. Root Cause Analysis shown that failures of rotating components such as idlers are the main responsible for unplanned shutdowns. Idler rollers are relatively simple and low reasonable running cost. However, their reliability has a large impact on the performance of long overland conveyors due to their large amount in service along the system (up to 26,500 idler rollers for a 10 km conveyor). The idler roller failures are stochastic. There is uncertainty in predicting its location, severity and time of occurrence. Since bearings have a limited lifespan, and a very large amount of idlers are operating under different conditions in a harsh environment, it is possible to estimate that a significant number of idler rollers are close to the fault condition, anytime. To meet cost per ton targets and zero harm goals, while reduce unplanned downtime, operators are installing different on-line condition based monitoring systems to continuously check on the health and provide early warning on problems with idler rollers. But, the deployment of idler monitoring systems presents several challenges in mining environments that must be addressed. This paper presents a technology review of idler condition monitoring systems for critical overland conveyors based on the operational key drivers claimed by personnel to upgrade their processes to predictive maintenance using a wireless-, smart-, and self-powered condition monitoring system. This includes initial investment, O&M costs, safety standards, instrumentation wiring issues, inexistence of power supply connections, and interference in wireless communications among other key design factors for mining. © 2017 IEEE.;Belt conveyors- Condition monitoring- Conveyors- Costs- Maintenance- Materials handling- Materials handling equipment- Mining- Monitoring- Ore treatment- Rollers (machine components)- Stochastic systems- Wireless telecommunication systems- Condition monitoring systems- Condition-based monitoring- Idlers- Instrumentation wiring- Overall equipment effectiveness- Predictive maintenance- Technology based applications- Wireless communications- Open pit mining;English;Conference Paper

New electromechanical film (EMFi) sensors are now able to detect minimal oscillations in its surface, allowing to detect the mechanical action of the heart as it beats. This has allowed to develop unobtrusive systems for heart rate monitoring to be used as Point-of-Care devices, and to deploy them in waiting rooms, assisted living facilities or at home. In this work, an EMFi sensor is used to measure BCG via the pressure changes on the seat produced by the beating heart. In a lab environment, 34 healthy volunteers are measured under two conditions: at rest and after exercise, simultaneously with ECG. Also, in a clinical environment, 24 volunteers are also measured while waiting. The algorithm looks for the variability of the length transform at different scales or windows to determine a search window to detect beats from the BCG. A second correlation filter helps eliminate false peaks detected due to noise in the signal. Results show that in resting conditions, the mean error between the BCG HR and the reference ECG is only 0.4 beats per minute, with a standard deviation of 1.88. The noise rejection accuracy is 93%. The proposed algorithm can be used to identify beats and issue alarms under abnormal rhythms, providing timely alerts for at-risk population. © 2017 IEEE.;Correlation detectors- Electrocardiography- Health care- Patient monitoring- At-risk population- Clinical environments- Correlation filters- Electromechanical film- Healthy volunteers- Heart-rate monitoring- Mechanical action- Standard deviation- Heart;English;Conference Paper

Traditionally, boost DC/DC converters are used with fast control to regulate the supply voltage of the output. However, since stimulators are acting as current sources, such voltage regulation is not needed. Banking on this, this paper presents a DC/DC conversion strategy aiming to increase power efficiency.

Equipotential intercell bars are made of a large continuous copper busbar conductor to receive the cathode currents from one cell, rebalance the potential of the electrodes, and split the current to the next cell anodes. The potential balance by the bar itself produces undesirable side circulating currents with respective extra power losses at electrode contacts and throughout the copper busbar. This Joule heating collateral effect increases the busbar temperatures, the corrosion rates, and the electrical resistivity when copper annealed. This phenomenon is present on industrial sites. Using 3-D multiphysics finite-element methods tuned with industrial parameters, this study produces a scientific answer for this phenomenon. For describing the side effects of the potential reset, the concept of circulating current is developed and presented. This concept resembles reactive currents and its effects in power systems. In short, it explains why equipotential busbars exhibit and suffer higher overheating and accelerated corrosion rates. By contrast, its current source counterpart's bars are free of circulating currents and overheating. Finally, industrial measurements are included to support the results. © 2016 IEEE.;Busbars- Copper- Corrosion- Corrosion rate- Electrodes- Energy utilization- Accelerated corrosion- Circulating current- Collateral effects- Electrical analysis- Industrial measurements- Intercell- Series configuration- THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEM- Finite element method;English;Article

Short circuits produce nodules in copper cathodes, impaired contacts elevate the current density dispersion, and open contacts result in blank cathodes and over currents around the anomalies. This work presents an intercell topology composed by a busbar, a capping board and secondary connectors placed on top. Resilience to anomalies is improving by reducing the occurrence and fast recovery from outlasting anomalies.

The actual physical condition of the plate, hanger bar assembly, and the internal resistance of electrodes are critical factors in this process. Internal electrode resistances affect parallel anode-cathode pair resistances. Therefore, it also alters balanced copper deposits, current efficiency, and cell voltage and power consumption of electrowinning cells. This paper summarizes the design characteristics of commercial stainless steel cathodes and cold-rolled lead-alloy anodes. It includes the evaluation of electrode performances under typical operating conditions using 3-D finite-element method analysis. The proposed evaluation of internal electrode resistance comprises nonlinear effects of electrical conduction, heat generation, and electrode position. The analysis of the design robustness of electrodes considers the most important elements, which help to maintain high current efficiency and electrical performance in the long term- that is to say, mechanical strength, inherent straightness, resistance to dissolution of copper coating on hanger bars, galvanic corrosion of weld joints, and hanger bar resistance to annealing. Results are based on industrial measurements, test work by vendors, and tankhouse operating data for benchmarking. The performance evaluation considers internal electrical resistance, contact shape design, contact loading, average contact resistance, and lifetime current efficiency.

The electrochemical kinetics of electrolytic processes is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition integrated to operation and housekeeping procedures, allows enhancing cathode quality and electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, and early identification of temperature excursions and electrolyte flow blockages. These abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation and energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, or safety issues from the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations and providing early warnings to face the wide variability of performance and safety conditions of cells caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a non-invasive wireless sensor for the monitoring of the temperature and electrolyte circulation flow estimation through each cell, suitable to highly-corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition monitoring sensor design is small size, lightweight, meets battery-free operation and non-sparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a RF link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation currently used for electrolytic process monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Cathodes- Condition monitoring- Copper- Electric batteries- Electrodes- Electrolytic cells- Energy utilization- Monitoring- Process monitoring- Production- Battery-free operations- Condition monitoring sensors- Electrochemical kinetics- Electrolyte circulations- Electrolytic process- Harsh environment- Harsh environment sensor- Wireless sensor- Electrolytes;English;Conference Paper

The sleep quality of mine workers is an important issue related to both goals. Miners are usually exposed to hard working shifts in a hostile environment, which can lead to deficient rest between shifts. Inadequate sleep is related to fatigue and higher risk of accidents. Sleep quality is traditionally evaluated by specialized medical personnel through polysomnography by measuring apneas, body movements (BMs), and the time in bed (TB), among other parameters, trying to determine the sleep depth. We present a noninvasive sleep evaluation device based on pressure sensors on the bed that can be used to measure relevant parameters to estimate sleep quality. This device can be easily unobtrusively installed at mining facilities and provide the TB, the respiration frequency, BMs, apnea events, and the sleep depth. We present preliminary results that validate the device for future studies at mining sites and as a new hazard control mechanism. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Mineral industry- Sleep research- Hostile environments- Medical personnel- Non-invasive monitoring- Polysomnography- Respiration frequency- Risk of accidents- Sleep monitoring- Sleep quality- Quality control;English;Article

The actual physical condition of the plate - hanger bar assembly and the internal resistance of electrodes are critical factors for electrowining practice. Electrode internal resistances affects parallel anode-cathode pair resistances, and correspondingly, balanced copper deposits, current efficiency, cell voltage and power consumption of electrowining cells. This paper summarizes the design characteristics of commercial stainless steel cathodes and cold-rolled lead-alloy anodes. It includes the evaluation of electrode's performance under typical operating conditions using 3D finite element analysis. The proposed evaluation of electrode's internal resistance comprises non-linear effects of electrical conduction, heat generation and electrodeposition. The analysis of the design robustness of electrodes considers the most important elements that help to maintain high current efficiency and electrical performance in the long term: mechanical strength, inherent straightness, resistance to dissolution of copper coating on hanger bars, galvanic corrosion of weld joints, and hanger bar resistance to annealing. Results use industrial measurements, test work by vendors and tankhouse operating data for benchmarking. The performance evaluation considers internal electrical resistance, contact shape design, contact loading, average contact resistance and lifetime current efficiency. The results highlight the relationship of electrode's design robustness and long term performance. © 2015 IEEE.;Alloy steel- Anodes- Cathodes- Cold rolling- Copper- Copper deposits- Design- Efficiency- Energy efficiency- Finite element method- Fluidized bed combustion- Heat resistance- Lead alloys- Metal cladding- Stainless steel- Steel sheet- Welds- Alloy anodes- Current efficiency- Internal resistance- Process performance- Service lifetime- Stainless steel cathodes- Electrodes;English;Conference Paper

This device can measure time in bed (TB), body movements (BM), the thorax expansion, periods out of bed (POB) and apnea events. We compare the results of the unobtrusive pressure sensor array with traditional polysomnography (PSG). The algorithms developed for the device provide a very good detection of all the parameters required to estimate sleep quality as compared to the gold-standard data for a study of 30 patients. For the periods out of bed it presents a sensibility (Se) and specificity (Sp) of 100%. To grade the severity of sleep apnea we compare the number of events per hour or apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) obtained by the device and the PSG- obtaining a Se of 94% and a Sp of 61%.

Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings- Part of 7th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2014;0;Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepcion, I-Concepción, Chile;Nocturnal bruxism (NB) is a temporomandibular disorder characterized by an excessive clenching and involuntary parafunctional grinding of the teeth during sleep. In this paper, we present a device that generates electrical stimulation to produce an inhibitory action of the muscles involved in the elevation of the jaw. The device measures the electromyographic (EMG) signal of the left temporalis anterior (LTa) muscle to determine the intensity of contraction. It then, stimulates the right mental nerve to produce a decrease in the contraction intensity of the jaw elevation muscles. The device was used by one bruxist subject for 12 nights. The results showed that, on average, the percentage decrease of the EMG activity was 43.55% when a bruxism event occurred. The events of nocturnal bruxism appeared mostly one and three hours after going to sleep. In conclusion, the electrical stimulation device generated an important inhibitory action of the LTa muscle when the subject was performing nocturnal bruxism. Thus, this result indicates that the device could be useful as a possible treatment for bruxism. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.

A number of operational disruptions affecting mine shovels have been related to energy quality. Previous investigations have highlighted the large presence of harmonics as the main factor responsible for these problems. The aim of this paper is to produce an energy quality baseline and a precise diagnosis of the source and nature of the energy quality issues based on standards and the susceptibility of different technologies used by the shovels at the site. The random nature of the load composed by multiple shovels and drills requires computer simulation to predict worst-case scenarios. For this purpose a voltage regulation and harmonic distortion study was conducted with the model parameters tuned by measurements taken in mobile substations of the mine energy loop. A major aim of this study is to establish the relationship between energy quality and energy efficiency. © 2014 IEEE.;Energy efficiency- Open pit mining- Shovels- Voltage regulators- Distribution systems- Energy quality- Model parameters- Worst case scenario- Quality control;English;Conference Paper

Specifically, mine shovel operation is frequently disrupted by energy quality issues. A number of alternative approaches to deal with this problem include: the use of reactive power compensator technologies (i.e. passive filters- electronically switched capacitor banks and static VAR compensators), imposing limits to mining cable lengths, increasing cross sections of the surface cables and increasing the power of mobile substations. However, for this industrial site those alternatives fail to obtain the desired power quality and are not compatible with a potential expansion of the mine pit. This paper presents a solution based on IEEE recommended practices by adding a new feeder with higher rated voltage to the mine loop. The result is better shovel availability, a reduction in arc flash risk and a 9.55% improvement in energy efficiency. There is also a carbon footprint reduction of 10.7 kTon of CO2 per year. © 2014 IEEE.;Cables- Carbon footprint- Energy efficiency- Filtration- Passive filters- Shovels- Static Var compensators- Cable length- Distribution systems- Energy quality- Industrial sites- Rated voltages- Reactive power compensator- Recommended practice- Switched capacitor banks- Open pit mining;English;Conference Paper

This leads to improved electrode alignment, reduced contact resistances, easier contact cleaning, and ensured electrical contact for the electrodes. It results in lower operational temperature for the electrodes, reduced plant housekeeping, increased lifespan for capping boards, and higher rate of grade A copper production.

The regulated voltage is obtained in the secondary of an inductive link and is controlled by varying the operating frequency of the inductive link. This frequency operation varies between 950 kHz and 1.2 MHz when the distance between the coils varies between 0mm and 40mm. The results show that it is not necessary to elevate the supply voltage of the external circuit to regulate the internal voltage.

These ways of voltage control reduce the power and heat dissipated inside the body. The first control system involves regulation of power supply voltage to the high frequency amplifier.

This paper introduces a design concept to avoid electrode open circuits and reduce contact resistances. The design is based on a female teeth shape for the contacts on the intercell bar. This leads to improved electrode alignment, reduced contact resistances, easier contact cleaning and ensured electrical contact for the electrodes. It results in lower operational temperature for the electrodes, reduced plant housekeeping, increased lifespan for capping boards and higher rate of grade A copper production.

For fairness and completeness, efficiency is calculated for three major battleground scenarios. The first is a low dynamic nonregenerative group of applications such as pumps, fans, and compressors. This group represents 85% of high power (∼2 MW) industrial applications where energy savings are usually a primary consideration justifying investment. The second scenario considers applications requiring good dynamic response and regenerative braking. Finally, the third group considers very high power applications (over 20 MW). The evaluation presented takes into account semiconductor switching and conduction losses, losses in the medium voltage feeding transformer (determined per IEEE Standard C57.18.10-1998), and the losses in ac and dc filters. For purposes of analysis, computer simulations validated against measurements taken on a 1-MW voltage source inverter (VSI) and a 1.4-MW current source inverter (CSI) were used.

Specifically, proposes a measurement technique for the cathodic currents in dog-bone type inter-cell bars using linear radiometric Hall effect sensors and ferromagnetic flux concentrators. The method is highly non-invasive and fully compatible with these processes - it does not require any modification to cell structures, and enables on-line monitoring of the cathode currents. This opens a window for full automation based on cathode weight and harvesting time estimation. It also enables process optimization and setting of the maximum process current Finally, adds the capability of detecting and locating metallurgical short-circuits upon early stages of genesis. The proposed measurement method was verified under different operational conditions using experimental data from a copper refinery facility.

One of the primary achievements of this bar is to limit short-circuit currents to a maximum of 1.5 pu of the actual process current However, low current short circuits are more difficult to detect. Thus, conventional short circuit detection instruments like gaussmeters and infrared cameras become ineffective. To overcome this problem the proposed method is based on detecting the voltage drop across anode-cathode pairs. The method does not affect the operation of the process and does not require modifications of the industrial plant.

The preferred industrial solutions for this type of application are thyristor-based double-bridge and fourstar multi-pulse rectifiers. A number of alternative more advanced rectifiers have been recently proposed presenting improved electrical properties, such as reduced harmonic distortion and reduced reactive power consumption. The various tradeoffs existent between these topologies have been evaluated only partially. This paper presents a full evaluation method based on standards. It should become a valuable tool for the plant design engineer offering quantitative figures to support the electrical project. The proposed method is based on the reliability, electrical performance, efficiency and required equipment investment for these rectifiers. The IEEE Standards 493-1997 and IEEE C57.18.10 for reliability and efficiency are the basis of this method, being used specifically to configure the evaluation platform.

However, the non-linear and turbulent nature of the flame, high dimensionality of the spectral data, and the overlap between continuous and discontinuous spectral emissions requires the use of complex method to obtain valuable information for combustion closed loop-control and optimization. This work analyzes the spectral emission of the flame emitted by LPG flames to compute high resolution spectra combining the Maloney-Wandell spectral recovery method and field information of flame images with low spectral resolution.

In this paper, we report a direct relationship between the visible and near-infrared emission spectra in the combustion of copper concentrates by changing some operating conditions such as the sulfur-copper and the oxygen ratios provided to the reaction zone. Spectral processing techniques are applied to the measured spectra. The first one aims to separate both continuous radiations mainly associated to incandescent particles and heating walls with discontinuous emissions associated with some emitting atoms and molecules. This goal was carried out using airPLS baseline estimation algorithm. The second processing technique aims to find the continuous emission only associated with the combustion of copper concentrate particles, eliminating the background spectra associated with the smelter walls. This goal was carried out by directly measuring walls emission at operating temperature and in the absence of flame. The most relevant results show that the estimation of the total radiation associated with each measured spectra is an intrinsic parameter of the process that can provide useful information to the operator that supervises the industrial process. It allows estimate quantitatively the sulfur-copper ratio in order to online monitor the mineral characteristics of the copper concentrate that is entering the process. On the other hand, the approach of a first prototype of the emissivity model for the copper concentrate particles, which validated with measurements, becomes a promising tool that will allow increasing the development of optoelectronic applications around this industry process. © 2019 BioMed Central Ltd..

The method consists of the use of training spectral data with a compressive capability. By using principal component analysis (PCA), a proper number of basis vectors are extracted. These vectors are properly combined and weighted by the sensors' responses from visible MODIS channels, achieving as a result the retrieval of hyperspectral images. Once MODIS channels are used for hyperspectral retrieval, the training spectra are projected over the recovered data, and the ground-based process used for training can be reliably detected. To probe the method, we use only four visible images from MODIS for large-scale ash clouds' monitoring from volcanic eruptions. A high-spectral resolution data of reflectances from ash was measured in the laboratory. Using PCA, we select four basis vectors, which combined with MODIS sensors responses, allows estimating hyperspectral images. By comparing both the estimated hyperspectral images and the training spectra, it is feasible to identify the presence of ash clouds at a pixel-by-pixel level, even in the presence of water clouds. Finally, by using a radiometric model applied over hyperspectral retrieved data, the relative concentration of the volcanic ash in the cloud is obtained. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the classical method based on temperature differences (using infrared MODIS channels), and the results show an excellent match, outperforming the infrared-based approach. This proposal opens new avenues to increase the potential of multispectral remote systems, which can be even extended to other applications and spectral bands for remote sensing. The results show that the method could play an essential role by providing more accurate information of volcanic ash spatial dispersion, enabling one to prevent several hazards related to volcanic ash where volcanoes' monitoring is not feasible. © 2019 by the authors.;Clouds- Hyperspectral imaging- Pixels- Principal component analysis- Radiometers- Remote sensing- Spectral resolution- Spectroscopy- High spectral resolution- MODIS satellite sensors- Multispectral satellite image- Relative concentration- Spectral retrieval- Temperature differences- Volcanic ash clouds- Volcanic eruptions- Volcanoes;English;Article

The standard setup controls the flame behavior by measuring the composition of the residual gases discharged to the atmosphere. However, such a solution involves an unavoidable transport delay due to the distance between the flame and the measurement sample, in addition to intrinsic delay in the sensor. In this work, we propose the optically monitoring of the combustion inferring the state of the process by the inclusion of a spectrometer to calculates a novel set of optical variables. Such approach provides an improvement in the monitoring and control of the process by calculating an accurate estimation of the energy efficiency by measuring the flame temperature Tf, the total radiation Radt proportional to the heat transfer- or by measuring the radicals ratio C2*/CH*.

Different combustion conditions are addressed, such as sulfur-copper ratio and oxygen excess. Temperature and spectral emissivity features are estimated for each case by using the two wavelength method and radiometric models. The most relevant results have shown an increasing intensity behavior for higher sulfur-copper ratios and oxygen contents, where emissivity is almost constant along the visible spectrum range for all cases, which validates the gray body assumption.

Both approaches are based on the detection of the Smoke Point Height (SPH), concept used to determine when a flame is in a sooting state. The first approach is based on the detection of morphological changes in the flame, identified through their amplification via the Eulerian Video Magnification algorithm. Results show an effective amplification of the flame geometry, allowing the visualization of variations on the flame tip unable to be detected by the naked human eye and therefore the detection of SPH. The second approach is based on the application of Artificial Intelligence models to classify flame images regarding their sooting propensity, taking advantage of the knowledge acquired from a referential data set. Both approaches provide an accurate classification when compared to the conventional method of LOSA. Furthermore, both approaches show a greater implementation potential in practical combustion devices than the conventional method of LOSA, due to their reduced hardware and technical requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;Classification (of information)- Combustion- Plasma diagnostics- Smoke- Soot- Conventional methods- Image magnification- Line-of-sight attenuations- Morphological changes- Practical combustion- Smoke point- Sooting propensities- Technical requirement- Artificial intelligence;English;Article

In this context, the current common operation setting in combustion processes could be improved by the introduction of passive optical sensors, which can be located close the flame, thus eliminating the inherent transport delay in current setups that only infer the combustion quality by measuring residual gases emissions. However, there is a tradeoff for flame detection between spatial-spectral resolutions, depending on the optical sensor scheme. In this paper, we present the fundamentals to avoid this constraint, obtaining a combined high spectral and spatial resolution measurement suitable for combustion diagnostics and control. The core of this proposal is to use the flame images from a low-spectral resolution charge-coupled device camera, combined with a spectral recovery method. This method is based on the off-line samples measured on the continuous component of flame spectra, providing a set of vector basis to estimate a calibrated flame spectra at each pixel. The results of the spectral recovery process verify the suitability of the method in terms of goodness-of-fit coefficient and root mean square error metrics, enabling hyper-spectral measurements based on the combination of different optical sensors. Then, continuous estimated spectra along the flame are used to calculate the energy transfer released by radiation, useful for combustion diagnostics. © 2001-2012 IEEE.;Calibration- Cameras- CCD cameras- Charge coupled devices- Economic and social effects- Energy efficiency- Energy transfer- Heat radiation- Image resolution- Optical sensors- Optical variables measurement- Plasma diagnostics- Spectral resolution- Spectrum analysis- Combustion diagnostics- Combustion pro-cess- Combustion qualities- Radiation-sensing- Spatial resolution- Spectral Estimation- Spectral measurement- Spectral recoveries- Combustion;English;Article

The non-parametric method estimates the baseline based on a set of sampled basis vectors obtained from PCA applied over a previously composed continuous spectra learning matrix. The parametric method, however, uses an ANN to filter out the baseline. Previous studies have demonstrated that this method is one of the most effective for baseline removal. The evaluation of both methods was carried out by using a synthetic database designed for benchmarking baseline removal algorithms, containing 100 synthetic composed spectra at different signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and baseline slopes. In addition to deomonstrating the utility of the proposed methods and to compare them in a real application, a spectral data set measured from a flame radiation process was used. Several performance metrics such as correlation coefficient, chi-square value, and goodness-of-fit coefficient were calculated to quantify and compare both algorithms. Results demonstrate that the PCA-based method outperforms the one based on ANN both in terms of performance and simplicity. © Society for Applied Spectroscopy.;Principal component analysis- Signal to noise ratio- Baseline estimation- Baseline removal- Comparative analysis- Continuous spectrum- Correlation coefficient- Learning matrix- Nonparametric methods- Sampled bases- Neural networks;English;Article

The key aspect of this study is the proper estimation of the continuous component or baseline of spectral signals containing spurious discontinuities. We compare both, a PCA based method against an alternative method based on an Artificial Neural Networks model. The accuracy and computational cost for baseline estimation in practical industrial applications is analyzed, in order to incorpore the radiation measurement as a variable suitable for control decisions. Several experiments in industrial facilities demonstrate the suitability of radiation measurement via flame spectrum analysis, in particular the relation between the proposed optical variable and the process operational conditions in the case of an oil boiler for steam production and a ladle furnace preheating process. As results, the methodology based on principal components analysis (PCA) provides high accuracy for baseline estimation in flame spectra, with metrics of RMSE≈0.1·10-4 and GFC&gt-0.99 with fast computation times, smaller than typical flame flickering. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A flame emits energy over a wide spectral region and its associated spectra contains both continuous and discontinuous components. In the literature there are models, based on either Planck's or Wien's law, for representing the flame spectral behavior under different combustion parameters- however, the non-linear nature of these models, the high dimension of the spectral data, and the superposition between the continuous and the discontinuous spectral emissions complicate the theoretical analysis of combustion processes. In this paper exploratory data analysis is used to derive data-driven models for combustion process monitoring. To do so, a database of measured spectra, collected from a real combustion process in the range of 400 to 800 [nm], is used as a priori information about the process. The database contains spectral information about continuous emissions of natural gas, oil, and bio-oil fuels at different combustion conditions. To summarize in a reduced number of terms the whole spectral information contained in the database, traditional as well as probabilistic Principal Component Analysis is conducted in order to create linear data-driven predictive models for combustion process monitoring. The predicting performance of the models is tested using the goodness-of-fit and the root-mean-squared error. The applicability of the models is finally tested by devising a simple automated solution for separating the discontinuous radiation from the continuous emission. © 2012 SPIE.;Automated solutions- Bio oil- Combustion condition- Combustion parameters- Combustion pro-cess- Continuous emission- Data-driven model- Exploratory data analysis- Goodness of fit- High dimensions- Industrial combustion process- Predictive models- Priori information- Probabilistic principal component analysis- Removing baseline- Root-mean-squared- Signal estimation- Spectral behaviors- Spectral data- Spectral emission- Spectral information- Spectral region- Database systems- Principal component analysis- Process control- Process monitoring- Combustion;English;Conference Paper

The algorithm estimates the continuous background based on previous information obtained from a learning database of continuous flame spectra. Then, the discontinuous flame emission is calculated by subtracting the estimated continuous baseline from the measured spectrum. The key issue subtending the learning database is that the continuous flame emissions are predominant in the sooty regions, in absence of discontinuous radiation. The proposed algorithm was tested using natural gas and bio-oil flames spectra at different combustion conditions, and the goodness-of-fit coefficient (GFC) quality metric was used to quantify the performance in the estimation process. Additionally, the commonly used first derivative method (FDM) for baseline removing was applied to the same testing spectra in order to compare and to evaluate the proposed technique. The achieved results show that the proposed method is a very attractive tool for designing advanced combustion monitoring strategies of discontinuous emissions. © 2012 Optical Society of America.;Molecular physics- Optics- Automated algorithms- Combustion condition- Combustion monitoring- Continuous flames- Estimation process- First derivative- Learning database- Spectrum techniques- Combustion;English;Article

As results of this analysis, Local and Global Spectral Radiation Measurements (LSRM and GSRM respectively) techniques are proposed, and guidelines for selecting the radical emission bands and spatial location of photodetectors are given. Two types of experiments have been performed in order to demonstrate the reliability of the GSRM technique for combustion characterization. In the first experiment, the LSRM and the GSRM have been implemented by using a home made sensor array, based on silicon photodiodes, for sensing the excited CH* and C2* radicals in a natural gas flame. It has been experimentally demonstrated that by using the GSRM, the signal's dispersion can be reduced to about 86% for the CH* and 76% for the C2* with respect to the obtained values with LSRM methodology. In the second experiment, the GSRM technique has been applied for sensing the CH* and C2* radicals, where it has been found that the signals emissions ratio C2*/CH* provides a good indicator of the thermal combustion efficiency and the CO pollutants emissions, with small dispersion. Thus, the GSRM technique has corroborated the usefulness of that ratio for combustion monitoring. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.;Co-pollutants- Combustion characterization- Combustion efficiencies- Combustion monitoring- Emission bands- Flame spectrum- Natural gas flames- Radiometric analysis- Silicon photodiode- Small dispersion- Spatial location- Spectral band- Spectral emission- Spectral radiation- Dispersions- Experiments- Gas emissions- Monitoring- Natural gas- Optical sensors- Optoelectronic devices- Sensor arrays- Combustion- silicon- analytic method- article- chemoluminescence- combustion- gas- priority journal- radiometry- sensor- spectroscopy;English;Article

The covered wavelengths evaluate the formation and behaviour of excited CH* and C2* radicals for confined gas flames. The monitoring of these radicals is carried out in the flame reaction region at the burner exit, where the C2*/CH* ratio signals provide enough information to identify the optimal fuel-air ratio in order to obtain the boiler maximal efficiency and to prevent an incomplete combustion. The experimental results obtained for two power levels, in a boiler of 150 kW, demonstrate that the C2*/CH* ratio provides important information concerningthe combustion state and gives a clear indication about the burner adjustment when CO emissions begin to increase to the upper the levels accepted by environmental laws.

One of the most used methods to obtain a discrete-time model from the continuous-time equations is to use an Euler approximation of the derivative. However, when sampling times are increased, an Euler discretized model may incur in error in the variables. This work presents an alternative discretization method based on the input-state linearization concept of nonlinear control. An auxiliary linear model is obtained which is then discretized by an exact linear approach. The method is illustrated using the dc-dc boost type converter as a case study showing improved results a compared with the Euler approximation. © 2022 IEEE.;Boost converter- Continuous time systems- Digital control systems- Discrete event simulation- Discrete time control systems- Model predictive control- Nonlinear equations- Predictive control systems- Volume measurement- Discrete - time systems- Discrete-time model- Discretization method- Euler approximation- Input state- Linearisation- Method of modeling- Modeling equations- Power conversion- Predictive control- Linearization;English;Conference Paper

Additionally, renewable energies operation -as solar- results in a non-polluting way to supply energy, being of special interest into highly contaminated cities and/or countries. The solar energy efficiency injection system is known to be high and mainly due to the power converters effectiveness, which is over of 95% for low and medium voltage. However, this efficiency is reduced when the solar array is partially shaded because traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are not able to find the maximum power point (MPP) under irregular radiation. This work presents a new algorithm to find the global MPP (GMPP) based upon two MPPTs algorithms used regularly in uniform solar condition (USC), these are the Measuring Cell (MC) and the Perturb and Observe (P&O) methods. The MC ensures to find the surroundings of every local MPP (LMPP) faster and then choose among them the surroundings of the GMPP. Once the surroundings of GMPP are found, the P&O is used to get closer to the GMPP but reducing the DC voltage oscillation to zero hence overcoming the main issue of the P&O. Thus, the proposed algorithm finds the GMPP in two main steps and eliminates the oscillations around the GMPP in steady state, despite the utilization of the P&O. The algorithm is detailed mathematically, illustrated by means of a block diagram, and validated in simulated and experimental results. © 2013 IEEE.;Electric inverters- Energy efficiency- Fossil fuels- Heuristic algorithms- Maximum power point trackers- Photoelectrochemical cells- Solar energy conversion- Solar power generation- DC-AC power converters- GMPPT- Heuristics algorithm- Inverter- Maximum Power Point Tracking- Partial shading- Partial shading algorithm- PV system- Shading algorithms- Solar energy;English;Article

Its control is usually performed by a cascade combination of linear controllers which must be properly tuned for correct operation, and which depend on the operating point and system parameters. These family of controllers place inherent limits on the system dynamic response. On the other hand, the predictive control approach has been proposed as an alternative technique for these converters due to its fast dynamic response, simple concept, flexibility, multiple objective capability, among other desirable properties. In the case of power converter applications, short prediction horizons are usually used due to computational limitations. However, when short horizons are considered, the non-minimum phase characteristic of the rectifier voltage response can introduce stability issues, as its direct inversion is not possible without jeopardizing it. Indeed, this may lead to voltage regulation loss, and in the worst case, overcurrents that could damage the converter. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes a new concept for a predictive horizon one voltage controller for grid-connected three-phase active front end rectifiers. The proposal is based on the minimum and non-minimum phase plant factorization concept and the use of different sampling periods, to prevent the direct inversion of the non-minimum phase voltage dynamic. Simulated and experimental results are included and show its correct operation, even with a horizon one predictive voltage controller, thus ensuring the fastest response of the system for a given sampling time. © 2013 IEEE.;Controllers- Dynamic response- Electric drives- Electric rectifiers- Linear control systems- Rectifying circuits- Voltage control- Voltage regulators- Active front end rectifiers- Direct inversion- Model-predictive control- Non-minimum phase- Power- Renewable energies- Three phase- Three phasis- Three-phase rectifiers- Voltage controllers- Model predictive control;English;Article

The two-level converter is still the most used, such as in the case of use in AC electrical machine drives or the inclusion of renewable energies in electrical systems. However, due to its admirable advantages, the multilevel converter is a valid alternative for higher quality and efficiency benefits. In particular, one of the most studied topologies is the cascaded H-Bridge, which can be classified according to its DC voltage ratios as symmetrical and asymmetrical. The latter makes it possible to obtain a high-quality output voltage waveform using fewer inverters per phase. However, this has drawbacks such as: (i) regeneration due to the modulation technique, (ii) asymmetric power distribution among the inverters, and (iii) loss of modularity. In this work, it is proposed to design a modulation technique for the generation of a stepped phase voltage based on the sum of modified square waves generated by H-bridge inverters in cascade with asymmetric DC voltage ratio in order to obtain a distribution of symmetrical active power between the cells and a minimum THD of the output phase voltage. For the above, the minimization of the THD of the output phase voltage is performed. As a result, the DC voltages and firing angles are obtained for each modified square waveform. Thus, for six cells per phase with m = 1.0, 6.976% of THD is obtained, and an efficiency of 95.32%. © 2022 IEEE.;Bridge circuits- Efficiency- Power electronics- Power quality- Asymmetric inverter- DC voltage ratio- DC-AC converter- High quality- Modulation techniques- Multilevel inverter- Multilevels- Output phase- Phase voltage- Static power converters- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

If the oscillating power is some-how compensated, then the DC inductor can be designed just as a function of the semiconductors’ switching frequency, reducing its value. This work explores the use of three-phase/single-phase cells magnetically coupled through their DC links to compensate for the oscillating power among them and, therefore, reduce the DC inductor value. At the same time, front ends controlled by a non-linear control strategy equalize the DC currents among coupled cells to avoid saturating the magnetic core. The effectiveness of the proposal is demonstrated using mathematical analysis and corroborated by computational simulation for a 110 kVA load per phase and experimental tests in a 2 kVA laboratory prototype. The outcomes show that for the tested cases, coupling the DC links by a 1:1 ratio transformer allows reducing the DC inductor value below 20% of the original DC inductor required. The above leads to reducing by 50% the amount of magnetic energy required in the DC link compared to the original topology without oscillating power compensation, keeping the quality of the cell input currents and the load voltage. © 2022 by the authors.

The sustained increase in the SCCs could exceed the rating of the CBs, dangerously spreading the fault. Several series-connected schemes, such as fault current limiters and series reactors, have been proposed in recent decades to reduce these high currents. This article designs and experimentally verifies the feasibility of a parallel-connected power converter to reduce the SCCs, operating as a controlled current source by absorbing current from the fault point. This new configuration reduces the SCCs in all CBs of an electrical substation. The proposed PFCA is implemented using a single-phase neutral-point clamped (NPC) converter and tested using a predictive current control scheme for short-circuits in a scaled-down power system. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, reducing significantly the first SCC peak, even when the ac bus voltage is close to zero. © 2013 IEEE.;Electric circuit breakers- Power converters- Short circuit currents- Controlled current source- Design and implementations- Electrical substations- Neutral point clamped converters- Parallel connected power converters- Power distribution grids- Power distribution system- Predictive current control- Fault current limiters;English;Article

For AC drives based on power cells assembled with three-phase diode rectifiers and cascaded H-bridge inverters, a sophisticated input multipulse transformer is required to reduce the grid voltage, provide isolation among the power cells, and compensate for low-frequency current harmonics generated by the diode-based rectifiers. However, this input multipulse transformer is bulky, heavy, and expensive and must be designed according to the number of power cells, not allowing total modularity of the AC drives based on cascade Hbridges. This study proposes and evaluates a control strategy based on a finite control set-model predictive control that emulates the harmonic cancellation performed by an input multipulse transformer in a cascade H-bridge topology. Hence, the proposed method requires conventional input transformers and replaces the three-phase diode rectifiers. As a result, greater modularity than the conventional multicell converter and improved AC overall input current with a THD as low as 2% with a unitary displacement power factor are achieved. In this case, each power cell manages its own DC voltage using a nonlinear control strategy, ensuring stable system operation for passive and regenerative loads. The experimental tests demonstrated the correct performance of the proposed scheme. © 2022 by the authors.

For this, two partial power and two interleaving methods are evaluated in terms of efficiency and performance. The selected topology consists of input-parallel-output-parallel interleaved DC/DC converters, which together with the control strategy, allows a high efficiency photovoltaic system, unlike conventional topologies. However, this type of topology is prone to present an unbalanced power distribution between the DC/DC power cells, mainly due to the natural differences between their components. This paper shows the application of a power balancing control strategy for interleaved partial power converters, which guarantees an equitable power distribution, therefore, it enables a correct sizing of the components.

Among the most common energy sources are the wind, solar, and sea, being one of the most relevant the solar energy, particularly in some countries as Chile. To transport the energy, solar system must be connected to a middle voltage level lines and therefore different topologies have been proposed where some of them are based on H-Bride. This work presents the use of H-Bridge power converters connected in parallel in the dc side and connected to a transformer in the ac side to pump up to middle voltage level. Additionally, as all phases of the H-Bridge are connected in parallel in the dc side, the third harmonic, typical of this topology, is compensated and therefore the ac waveform results free of low frequency harmonics. To get the maximum power from the solar array, it is employed a maximum power point tracker which uses measuring cells, avoiding oscillations around the maximum power point.

This method maintains the advantages of the conventional finite set - model predictive control, such as fast response, simple implementation, and easy understanding- but it also eliminates the use of a cost function and hence the weighting factors, instead, it finds the optimal operating state directly from the model and the discrete number of valid states of the converter. Although the proposed algorithm does not compute a cost function, it is able to select the inverter state that minimizes the tracking error by using a hexagonal convergence region. The main advantage of this technique is to reduce the computational cost in 43% of the algorithm that selects the best state, presenting a simple and complete algorithm without compromising the predictive control performance. The proposed algorithm properly operates under various conditions such as changes in the network frequency and changes in the system parameters. © 2013 IEEE.;Cost functions- Set theory- Computational costs- Convergence region- Discrete numbers- Network frequency- Photovoltaic generation system- Predictive control- Simplified method- Weighting factors- Model predictive control;English;Article

One of its classic topologies is the Cascaded H-Bridge, which requires isolated DC voltages to work. Depending on the DC voltage ratio used in the Cascaded H-bridge can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric. In comparison between symmetric and asymmetric inverters, the latter can generate an AC output voltage with more output voltage levels. DC voltage ratio most documented are binary and trinary.

Despite this advantage, the multipulse transformer is bulky, heavy, expensive, and must be designed according to the number of power cells required by a specific case, limiting the modularity of the topology. This work proposes a multicell converter based on power cells that requires a standard input transformer and uses active front-end rectifiers controlled by employing a finite control set-model predictive control algorithm. The proposed approach emulates the multipulse transformer harmonic cancelation owing to the predictive algorithm operation combined with input current references that are phase-shifted for each active front-end rectifier. Simultaneously, the DC voltages of the power cells are regulated and equalized among the cells using PI regulators. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed system as input currents in each Multicell AFE rectifier with a unitary displacement factor, and a low THD of 1.87% was obtained.

This last feature imposes computational constraints and short prediction horizons are therefore needed. In fact, in many applications an horizon one FCS-MPC controller is used. However, using FCS-MPC with a short prediction horizon in topologies that exhibit non-minimum phase behavior such as active-front-end rectifiers, dc-dc boost converters, and Z-source converters, among others, may lead to control issues. This work studies the origin of these control issues using nonlinear control theory considering a dc-dc boost converter as a case study. It is shown that the difficulty to directly control the converter output voltage using short horizon FCS-MPC is the resulting unstable internal dynamic, as the short horizon FCS-MPC controller acts like an input-output linearizing controller.

The most employed control techniques are linear control, nonlinear control based on linear and nonlinear feedback, and predictive control. The controllers associated with linear and nonlinear algorithms usually have a fixed switching frequency, featuring a defined spectrum given by the pulse width modulation (PWM) or space vector modulation (SVM) time period. On the other hand, finite set model predictive control (FS-MPC) is known to present a variable switching frequency that results too high for high power applications, increasing losses, reducing the switches lifetime and, therefore, limiting its application. This paper proposes a predictive control approach using a very low sampling frequency, allowing the use of predictive control in high power applications. The proposed method is straightforward to understand, is simple to implement, and can be computed with off-the-shelf digital systems. The main advantage of the proposed control algorithm comes from the combination of the model predictive control and the SVM technique, drawing the principal benefits of both methods. The provided experimental results are satisfactory, displaying the nature of space vector-based schemes but at the same time the fast response as expected in predictive control. © 2021 by the authors.;Linear control systems- Model predictive control- Nonlinear feedback- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Pulse width modulation- Switching frequency- Vector spaces- Voltage control- Control strategies- Fixed switching frequency- High power applications- Non linear control- Nonlinear algorithms- Predictive control- Sampling frequencies- Space vector modulations (SVM)- Power control;English;Article

These characteristics are attractive for medium and high voltage applications where high dv/dt is prohibitive and reduced switching losses are a must, or in applications that use passive filters and where a spread harmonic spectrum can cause resonances. The proposed strategy achieves dynamic results similar to those of conventional predictive control and a steady-state performance similar to that of a modulated control strategy. To do so, the strategy utilizes a modulated integral action to incorporate an input restriction into a conventional predictive control cost function. A grid-connected cascaded H-Bridge multilevel inverter is used to validate the strategy. Simulated and experimental results in both steady and transient states are presented to verify the proposed strategy's performance in the converter. © 2013 IEEE.;Bridge circuits- Cost functions- Electric inverters- Model predictive control- Passive filters- Predictive control systems- Voltage control- Cascaded h-bridge multilevel inverters- Conventional approach- Fixed switching frequency- High voltage applications- Steady and transient state- Steady state errors- Steady state performance- Zero steady state error- Switching frequency;English;Article

Micro-grids, systems working in islanding mode, are particular cases where some disadvantages are present due to the wide variations which may appear across their electrical quantities. Variations on the voltage amplitude and the frequency are intrinsic in the operation of weak grids, because they have low inertia and therefore the load must be able to cope with these variations, otherwise loads may trip electrical system protection. Particularly, on power electronic drives, these frequency deviations will lead to increased system nonlinearities, entailing a more critical controller design. To overcome these issues, this paper presents an implementation of a resonant controller with self-tuned gains. The strategy imposes a constant sampling time which allows these controllers to be used in variable frequency environments. In addition, the computational capacity required for the digital board is also considered. The simulated and experimental results provided demonstrate the good performance of this proposal. © 2013 IEEE.;Controllers- Distributed power generation- Electric power transmission networks- Energy storage- Microgrids- Resonance- Self tuning control systems- Tuning- Computational capacity- Electrical quantities- Electrical system protection- Frequency deviation- Power electronic drive- Resonant controller- System nonlinearities- Variable frequencies- Electric power system control;English;Article

The D-STATCOM is analyzed using its mathematical model, showing the strong relation of the D-STATCOM power losses and its DC current level. Using the operating region of the D-STATCOM, an operating sub-region is defined such that the minimum DC current is used for a required reactive compensation, which leads to reducing the operating losses in the D-STATCOM. Also, Selective Elimination Harmonic is used to modulate the equipment to reduce the switching frequency while ensuring a desired current quality in the D-STATCOM input. As a result, a simple control strategy is proposed that uses a fixed modulation index while a phase control regulates the DC current to the lowest value required for reactive power compensation. Mathematical analysis jointly with simulated and experimental results corroborates the proposal, showing that it is possible to achieve a suitable compensation capability for improving the efficacy of the STATCOM. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;Electric current regulators- Power quality- Reactive power- Compensation capability- Current source converters- Displacement power factor- Distribution static synchronous compensators- Mathematical analysis- Medium-voltage distribution systems- Reactive power compensation- Selective harmonic elimination- Static synchronous compensators;English;Article

The FCS-MPC is a control scheme popularly used in power converters because, among others, (i) the nonlinearities and constraints of the converter's operation, are quickly considering, (ii) it uses the natural discrete operation of power converters, and (iii) the rapid response to changes in both references or disturbances. However, the variable switching frequency operation in model-based predictive control results in a spread harmonic spectrum, generating resonances or saturation in input transformers when used in active front-end (AFE) rectifiers. This paper proposes an improved FCS-MPC, using a feedback Quantizer applied in a multi-cell AFE rectifier.

Moreover, its direct implementation in digital-based systems has made it an attractive strategy in static power converter applications. However, its characteristics such as variable switching frequency and spread harmonic spectrum limit the use of standard MPC due to power losses, audible noise, steady-state performance, and resonances. To mitigate these problems and extend the FCS-MPC applications to new areas, this paper proposes a new hybrid predictive control scheme, capable of achieving a harmonic spectrum distribution similar to that obtained with a pulse-width modulation scheme. The proposed strategy is based on a system model to generate an optimization, and, at the same time, an input restriction in the cost function of the standard FCS-MPC. This new approach is validated through experimental tests carried out in a grid-connected Cascaded H-bridge inverter. © 2020 by the authors.;Bridge circuits- Cost functions- Electric inverters- Model predictive control- Predictive control systems- Voltage control- Attractive strategies- Cascaded H-bridge inverters- Control objectives- Fixed switching frequency- Optimization problems- Predictive control- Static power converters- Steady state performance- Switching frequency;English;Article

The best results will be achieved if and only if the parameters and variables that make up the system are properly estimated. If this is not the case, the predictions made using these strategies may be erroneous and cause problems, such as steady-state error with respect to the assigned desired references. This paper presents a predictive control strategy with integral action that compensates for the differences between the estimated model and the inverter with the objective of achieving a zero steady-state error without requiring external loops or state observers.

Dr. Manuel Nava 8, Zona Universitaria, San Luis PotoSi, 78290, Mexico- Electrical Engineering Department, Universidad de Concepción, Edmundo Larenas 219, Concepción, Chile;This paper proposes an indirect model predictive control (I-MPC) strategy that allows considering long-length horizons to control a modular multilevel converter (MMC) working as an inverter, where such a MMC has the purpose to transfer bidirectionally active power to the grid, and simultaneously compensate reactive power. In the proposed scheme the dynamic matrix control (DMC) technique is adopted to generate the direct power control (DPC), where new power references are computed by taking into account the system behavior from a detailed circuit or model. In addition, the DMC allows to present a hybrid modulation structure that involves a sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) together with a voltage capacitor balance strategy. Finally, with the aim to illustrate the feasibility of controlling highly redundant converters, the MMC, the hybrid modulation technique and the control scheme are tested on a real-time simulation environment OPAL-RT®. © 2018;Electric inverters- Electric power system control- Electric power transmission- Model predictive control- Modulation- Predictive control systems- Real time systems- Standby power systems- Voltage control- Direct power control- Dynamic matrix control- Electronic application- HVDC transmission lines- Modular multi-level converters- Predictive controller- Real time simulations- Sinusoidal pulse width modulation- Power control;English;Article

Its main advantages are its conceptual simplicity, fast control response, flexibility and direct consideration of non linearities as well as constraints. Due to computational constraints, short prediction horizons are usually desired in power converters. However, control issues may appear when applied in topologies that exhibit non-minimum phase behavior such as active front end rectifiers and boost dc-dc converters. This work proposes the use of the concept of statically equivalent outputs in order to control these systems with the shortest prediction horizon. The proposed predictive controller partially inverts the plant dynamics, determining an auxiliary output by means of nonlinear control tools.

Passive filters are inevitable for power electronic devices with grid coupling. In this context LCL filter topologies are a recognized cost and space reducing alternative to simple single coil solutions for grid current harmonic attenuation. Since this type of filter represents a third order plant, a simple PI controller would cause instabilities once applied to control the grid current of the undamped filter. A common approach is the addition of a so called active damping to the PI-controller. Documented solutions refer to the feedback of specific state variables and/or implementation of additional filters. The corresponding parameter determination turns out to be generally quite complicated as it often deals with several variables. This article provides practicing engineers with a simple and effective recipe to determine just one active damping parameter for PI current controllers applied to three phase power converters with grid connection via LCL filters. A simple and generally valid formula is derived via the Hurwitz stability criterion that determines a safe operating area of this single parameter. © 2018 AEIT.;Controllers- Damping- Electric current control- Electric power system control- Electric power systems- Electric power transmission networks- Power converters- Renewable energy resources- Stability criteria- Active damping- LCL filters- Parameter determination- PI current controllers- Power electronic devices- PWM inverter- Renewable energy technologies- Three-phase power converter- Passive filters;English;Conference Paper

These devices need to be controlled where predictive control strategy has gained significant acceptance on the academic researches and on industry applications because its simplicity and fast dynamic response. This work presents a predictive control strategy oriented to control Cascaded H-Bridges to work under low sampling and switching frequencies using the PWM technique to ensure a given switching frequency. To cancel some undesired harmonics, the carrier of PWM can be phase-shifted to reduce the harmonics distortion. Furthermore, the switching function guarantees to change the state in just one leg at every sampling time and the other leg changes its value as a function of the sign of the voltage injected, which reduces the total losses on the power converter. The proposed strategy is analyzed mathematically and corroborated by simulation results. © 2017 IEEE.;Bridge circuits- Harmonic analysis- Power electronics- Predictive control systems- Pulse width modulation- Commutation frequency- Fast dynamic response- Industry applications- Multilevel converter- Multilevel topologies- Multilevels- Predictive control- Predictive control strategy- Power converters;English;Conference Paper

The power-voltage characteristic of a photovoltaic array is a nonlinear function that becomes more complex under partial shading conditions, in fact, the power-voltage curve may exhibit multiple local maximum power points. The proposed algorithm uses two PV reference cells, every 900 m 2 , one operating in open-circuit and the other one in short-circuit, to estimate the solar radiation and the ambient temperature conditions of the PV arrays. The results show an estimation error of the ambient conditions lower than 1% of the actual values. As a result, the arrays provide the maximum power possible for any distribution of irradiance and temperature conditions. © 2018 IEEE.;Industrial electronics- Photovoltaic cells- Global maximum power point tracking- Multiple local maximums- Nonlinear functions- Partial shading- Photovoltaic systems- Power -voltage curves- Power voltage characteristics- Temperature conditions- Maximum power point trackers;English;Conference Paper

The proposal has two advantages- first, it requires just a first order capacitive filter on the ac side as compared to the second order LC filter needed by voltage source based topologies. As a result, sags and swells can be compensated without the hassle of oscillations at the load voltage side- second, an external control loop is added to regulate the dc current value. This technique is based on the converter modulating vector magnitude control, and it guarantees the system operation at minimum dc link current, which minimizes the conducting and commutating losses. The topology and control scheme can be extended to multi-level configurations, which makes the arrangement suitable for medium to high voltage applications using standard semiconductors.

The popularity of this converter lies in its flexibility to independently control active and reactive powers. This paper introduces an approach to establish the power limitations of the BTB-VSC converter in the linear region. The theoretical expressions are developed using the dq model of the system. The methodology is functional and identifies the capabilities and limitations of the BTB-VSC converter in controlling the active and reactive powers. The study is useful for (1) assigning appropriate references to the controllers and avoiding unreachable power references and (2) dismissing the attribution of possible failures to the control system. As a result, it is possible to establish whether the power application requirements are covered by the BTB-VSC converter. Results validate the boundaries of the active and reactive powers and an algorithm is implemented to construct the graphic areas of the active and reactive power regions. Moreover, a nonlinear control strategy based on input–output feedback linearization is implemented to corroborate the approach.

First, a model of a three-phase electric generation system is used that combines photovoltaic panels and an inverter with an LCL filter at network side. In addition, a control algorithm capable of exchanging between two operating modes is implemented. Indeed, the first one is generated by the MPPT and the second one is generated when the grid demands more energy than the photovoltaic panel can generate. The results show that the PV system can provide additional energy - for a short period of time - from the dc link as emulating a large rotating inertia.

In order to check the technical feasibility and performance of the proposed topology, a mathematical model is introduced and studied and key design guidelines of passive components are defined. The analysis shows the possibility of using components with a lower voltage rating than that of the classic multilevel current source topologies and allows the use of low switching frequencies in both rectifier and inverter stages while at the same time obtaining a high-quality waveform in both load voltage and converter input currents.

However, the main drawback of this converter is the complexity of the control system due to the multiple control objectives which include the input, output, circulating current and the capacitor voltages. Several control schemes for the capacitor voltages have been proposed, being usually divided into the control of the average voltage and the balancing of the capacitor voltages among the submodules and among the arms. These control schemes can effectively control the capacitor voltage when the reference is the same for all arms, but they cannot manage arbitrary voltage references when each arm capacitor voltage must be controlled independently as required, for example, to achieve maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic applications. This paper proposes a control strategy for a modular multilevel converter capable to manage the average capacitor voltage of each arm independently. The proposed scheme is based on a decomposition of the energy of the arms in different components, according to theirs symmetries. Results validating the performance of the proposed control scheme are shown and the impact on the output current is also discussed. © 2015 IEEE.;Capacitors- Electric current control- Maximum power point trackers- Power electronics- Capacitor voltages- Circulating current- Control objectives- Control strategies- Maximum Power Point Tracking- Modular multilevel converters- Modular structures- Photovoltaic applications- Power converters;English;Article

This approach is used in this work considering a variable grid frequency environment in order to get an appropriate response for a wide ac mains frequency range. Indeed, in order to achieve appropriate, both dynamic and static, responses for all operating frequencies, the number of samples per period is kept constant and independent of the ac mains frequency. This allows a fixed resolution of the sensed voltages and/or currents, which is preferable if high-performance digital control schemes are required. However, imposing a constant number of samples per period requires a variable sampling time in systems that feature variable ac mains frequency. On the other hand, predictive control has been developed and well documented just for a constant sampling frequency. This work presents how to extend the predictive control algorithms for variable sampling time allowing high-performance waveforms and wider ac mains frequency range. Simulated and experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy which corroborates the mathematical and model analysis. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Algorithms- Digital control systems- Power converters- Constant sampling frequency- Control strategies- Number of samples- Operating frequency- Predictive control- Predictive control algorithm- Variable frequencies- Variable sampling- Sampling;English;Article

The proposed strategy is capable to balance the capacitor voltages at the DC link and to generate a sinusoidal current at the grid side with a unitary power factor. Differently to other approaches, the proposed scheme is easy to digitally implement, and does not need to retune the controller cost function weighting parameters, and reduces the computational effort.

The parameters error can be due to both a poor estimation and their time variant behavior, as the grid parameters in grid connected static power converters. Contrary to the standard FCS-MPC approach that tracks a system output reference, the proposed scheme is based on a system input reference tracking that can be obtained from a state-feedback. In the proposed scheme, output system integrators are added to modify the dynamic performance and ensure zero steady-state error under parameters errors. This approach overcomes one important disadvantage that presents the conventional FCS-MPC strategy which is the dependence of a model with accurate parameters to avoid performance degradation. The results verify the correct performance in both with or without parameters errors. © 2016 IEEE.;Energy conversion- Errors- Feedback- Model predictive control- Predictive control systems- State feedback- Static converters- Dynamic performance- Finite control set- Parameter sensitivities- Performance degradation- Reference-tracking- Static power converters- Three phase vsi- Zero steady state error- Power converters;English;Conference Paper

These kinds of grids are usually under significant variation in their quantities, specifically in their voltage amplitude and/or frequency. On this line, many studies about synchronization methods have been developed, which may work under variations on the frequency value, unbalanced voltage, and even with harmonic distortion. However, power converters connected to this class of systems are poorly documented - specifically controlled rectifiers. In fact, most of the controlled grid connected converters (GCCs) are defined to work in a fixed frequency and balanced system. This paper deals with a GCC connected to a variable-frequency and unbalanced voltage supply system control through a predictive algorithm with a fixed resolution sampling strategy. Furthermore, the current references are imposed in order to help the weak-grid source subjected to unbalancing, taking more power from the phase with highest voltage amplitude and relaxing the other phases. This issue makes to calculate every phase current reference independently and accordingly the voltage amplitudes keep the dc-link voltage in a desired value. The results show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, where the performance is highlighted by simulated and experimental waveforms. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Distributed power generation- Electric power transmission networks- Fighter aircraft- Model predictive control- Power converters- Rectifying circuits- Controlled rectifier- Distributed power generation systems- Grid-connected converters- Predictive algorithms- Predictive control- Synchronization method- Unbalanced voltage supply- Variable frequencies- Electric rectifiers;English;Article

Técnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaíso, Chile;Controlled Power Converters are extensively used in industrial applications as they can adapt the electrical energy as required by the application. However, these devices must be properly commutated in order to control voltages and currents. Indeed, power converters are known to be multivariable, coupled, and nonlinear systems- therefore, the control technique needs to be chosen carefully. There are several control techniques reported in the literature for power converters and one of them is the Resonant Control (RC) mainly used on ac based systems. Advantageously, RC guarantees zero steady state error for a sinusoidal reference with a constant frequency and, in addition, it does not need a stationary to rotating reference frame transformation. However, the conventional RC approach requires the exact ac mains frequency value to ensure zero steady state error, being a significant drawback for applications where variable frequency environments are expected. This paper proposes an enhanced RC scheme capable to work under variable frequency scenarios, as in weak and micro grid systems while guaranteeing zero steady state error. The scheme results in a simple algorithm based upon discrete mathematics whose parameters become independent of the ac grid frequency. Results show the feasibility of the proposed approach even under severe ac frequency variations (over 100%) while featuring a stable control loop operation and zero steady state error. © 2016 IEEE.;Energy conversion- Errors- Multivariable systems- Power control- Power converters- Resonance- Control techniques- Discrete mathematics- Frequency variation- Micro-grid systems- Resonant controls- Rotating reference frame- Variable frequencies- Zero steady state error- Electric power system control;English;Conference Paper

The four-leg indirect matrix converter can supply energy to an unbalanced three-phase load while providing a path for the zero sequence load. The predictive current control technique is based on the optimal selection among the valid switching states of the converter by evaluating a cost function, resulting in a simple approach without the necessity for modulators. Furthermore, zero dc-link current commutation is achieved by synchronizing the state changes in the input stage with the application of a zero-voltage space vector in the inverter stage. Simulation results are presented and the strategy is experimentally validated using a laboratory prototype. © 2014 IEEE.;Electric current control- Matrix converters- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Vector spaces- Ac-ac conversion- Current control strategy- Experimental validations- Four-leg converter- Indirect matrix converter- Modulation schemes- Predictive control- Predictive current control- AC-AC power converters;English;Article

Indeed, they offer a wide variety of alternatives to address the steady-state characteristics required by the system. Nevertheless, its computation and modulation delay negatively affects its dynamic performance. In order to improve the time response of the system, the modulator is avoided and the strategies of direct choice of the switching state have been presented. They can provide a very fast dynamic response- however, the absence of switching state sequences makes more complex the task of establishing specific switching features for improved steady-state performance. In this work, a control scheme that selects a specific control strategy according to the operating condition of the system is proposed. This allows using modulators to satisfy the switching characteristics required in steady-state and avoids its use when a rapid dynamic response is required. In addition, a soft transition method between the control strategies is presented to prevent unwanted behaviors when these are alternated. The proposed control scheme allows simplifying the design and keeps the main advantages of each selected strategy. To validate the scheme, experimental results are obtained for a control structure that alternates between a finite set model predictive control (direct type for rapid dynamic response) and a proportional integral (PI) control with sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) (modulated type for high steady-state performance). © 2015 IEEE.

However, the control of such converters is very challenging due to the number of control objectives to be achieved simultaneously. The input and output currents must be controlled at their own references, and these references must be properly generated in order to keep the average capacitor voltage constant. The circulating current can be controlled either to minimize losses or to reduce capacitor voltage ripple. Additionally, the capacitor voltage must be kept balanced among cells during the converter operation. In this paper, a model with four independent dynamical components of the arm currents, which also considers the effect of ac and dc systems, is proposed. The proposed model facilitates the dynamical analysis of currents and simplifies the design and implementation of current controllers. Analysis of the proposed current model and experimental results, which confirm the performance of the designed controllers, is shown. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Capacitors- Controllers- DC power transmission- Electric power transmission- HVDC power transmission- Capacitor voltage ripple- Capacitor voltages- Circulating current- Design and implementations- Dynamical components- High scalabilities- High voltage dc (HVDC) transmissions- Modular multilevel converters- Power converters;English;Article

The current-control mechanism decouples the PV system dynamic from those of the network and searches for unitary power factor at the grid side. The DC-link voltage-control scheme achieves maximum active power output.

Predictive Torque Control (PTC) has been developed to control induction motor drives, allowing high-performance and fast dynamics. However, the optimization used in PTC is based on a single cost function minimization, where control objectives are merged by using weighting factors. The adjustment of these factors is achieved through a nontrivial process and they are heavily dependent on the system parameters. To avoid this process, a Multiobjective Fuzzy Predictive Torque Control (FPTC) is presented.

This feature permits the interconnection of an arbitrary number of power cells by just stacking power cells up to achieve the desired voltage and power levels. The DC voltage regulation in each power cell is done by the Active Front End (AFE) converter, which uses a nonlinear control scheme for ensuring the stable operation of the system. Simulated results show the correct performance of proposed scheme. © 2015 IEEE.;AC motors- Cells- Cytology- Energy conversion- Harmonic analysis- HVDC power transmission- Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Rectifying circuits- Voltage regulators- Active front end converters- AFE Rectifier- Finite control set- Harmonic cancellation- Low-frequency currents- Low-voltage semiconductors- Multi-cell converters- Total harmonic distortion (THD)- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

Micro-grid and weak-grid systems are commonly associated to distribute non-conventional power generation sources, where the voltage and frequency deviation are as a result of unbalances between generation and consumed power. This work studies and develops a Series Compensator control for a non-constant power supply. The study is focused on the rectifier control in order to get a stable closed loop system for sags and swells as well as frequency variations. In addition, an operating region study is performed in order to evaluate the capabilities and to find the maximum range of frequency variation tolerated by this topology. Finally, simulated results show the feasibility of the proposed control for a wide frequency and voltage variation. © 2015 IEEE.;Closed loop systems- Electric power transmission networks- Power converters- Conventional power- Frequency deviation- Frequency variation- Micro-grid systems- Operating regions- Series compensator- Variable frequencies- Voltage variation- Electric power system control;English;Conference Paper

In particular, the trinary one can provide a waveform with 3n levels, where n is the number of cells connected in cascade. Hence, for n = 3, an output voltage with 27 levels can be obtained, ensuring a low total harmonic distortion (THD) and reduced dv/dt. However, when the load consumes active power, some power cells of the inverter can operate in regeneration mode, complicating the topology and control. To overcome this problem, a new modulation method for asymmetric inverters is presented. It features an ac output voltage of 13 levels for n = 3, and ensures unidirectional power flow in every power cell. This new modulation method also provides a voltage waveform with low dv/dt and reduced THD (5.7%). To confirm the approach, power flow and sensitivity analysis to changes in the dc voltage ratios are performed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided. © 2014 IEEE.;Cells- Cytology- Modulation- Topology- Wave filters- DC voltage ratio- DC-AC power converters- DC-link voltages- Multilevel converter- New modulation- Output voltages- Total harmonic distortion (THD)- Voltage waveforms- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

These topics are particularly important in the operation of power converters where passive filters present resonant modes and in the switching losses reduction. Contrary to standard model predictive control algorithms, the proposed scheme allows for obtaining time-continuous outputs from the optimization process. Thus, the advantages of modulated schemes, like a defined spectrum and fixed switching frequency, are inherited. The tradeoff is a slight reduction on the dynamic response, in comparison with previous schemes using direct non-modulated outputs.

One of the most popular topologies in this field is the 18 pulses diode rectifier, which uses a mu Iti pu I so transformer that realizes a current harmonics cancelation that are generated by the three phase diode rectifiers. In this work an efficiency comparison of the aforementioned topology and a Multi-Cell Active-Front-End (AFE) Rectifier operating with Finite Control Set - Model Predictive Control is performed. This efficiency comparison is focused on the rectifier losses divided into two types. The first one is the semiconductors switching and conduction losses. The second one evaluates the transformer losses, which are studied under two criteria: copper losses (Standard IEEE C57.10-1998) and the K - Factor (Standard IEEE / ANSI C57.110). The results show that the diode based rectifier topology has lower semiconductors losses, while the topology based on AFE rectifiers has lower transformers losses and a less complex design. Indeed, a reduction of a 7.2% in copper losses is achieved in the transformer secondary with respect to a multi-pulse transformer secondary. © 2014 IEEE.;Copper- DC transformers- Diodes- Electric rectifiers- Energy efficiency- Industrial electronics- Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Pulse transformers- Semiconductor diodes- Topology- AC-DC power converters- Efficiency comparisons- Multilevel converter- Predictive control- Rectifier topologies- Three phase diode rectifier- Transformer loss- Transformer secondaries- Rectifying circuits;English;Conference Paper

In order to reduce the DC inductor size, two compensation methods which compensated the oscillating power are evaluated and compared with the basic topology that use a large DC inductor. The first method consists in reducing the oscillating power through active compensation, which needs to supply the oscillating power from the rectifier, and the second method consists in reducing the oscillating power through magnetic coupling. The comparison considers the operating region, the DC inductor size, the magnetic power requirements, and the cell supply voltage requirements. Because the operating region is based on the converter and load parameters but independent of the DC inductor value, the passive parameters are designed as a function of the imposed rectifier input current quality and the load voltage THD. The comparison is done for a 9.33 MVA topology, simulating in PSEVI® in order to corroborate the components design and both the input current and load voltage quality. The operating region comparison is computed with one and two cells per phase and the achieved DC inductor reduction. © 2014 IEEE.;Bridge circuits- Cells- Cytology- Electric inductors- Electric inverters- Industrial electronics- Magnetic couplings- Rectifying circuits- Topology- Active compensation- Cascade H bridges- Cascaded H-bridge- Compensation method- Current source inverter- Input current qualities- Multicell- Operating regions- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

This work shows that it is possible to split the compensation tasks depending on the frequency components present on the line current that is intended to be compensated by using the superposition principle and the modular features of an H-bridge based multilevel STATCOM. This approach allows the implementation of the topology with dedicated modules in order to decouple and simplify the control algorithms. The H-bridge modules can be implemented with two different kinds of semiconductors: (i) slow switches for fundamental frequency compensation modules and (ii) fast switches for harmonic frequency compensation modules. As the modules meant for harmonic cancellation can self-regulate its dc voltage, they can follow the load requirements and thus operate with minimum power. The theoretical analysis is validated in a laboratory prototype. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Algorithms- Electric current regulators- Harmonic analysis- Frequency components- Fundamental frequencies- Harmonic cancellation- Harmonic compensation- Harmonic frequency- Multilevel power converters- Static compensator- Superposition principle- Synchronous machinery;English;Article

In this paper, two single-phase and one three-phase phase-locked loop methods are studied. The resulting PLLs algorithms are completely developed in the discrete plane in order to be directly applied on digitals systems as DSPs or FPGAs. The objective is to get PLLs as simple as it can be accomplished, with the purpose to reduce the computing time. Weak network supply systems and systems working in islanding mode have usually poor short circuit capacity. In addition, the source impedance leads to a much polluted voltage supply signal in the presence of nonlinear loads. In order to get an appropriate synchronization, a Rectangular Windows Filter (RWF) is employed as a noise rejecter. For unbalanced systems, two approaches to get synchronism are presented, where the unbalanced system can be due to sensors failures or power problems in the grid voltage. © 2014 IEEE.;Electric power distribution- Phase locked loops- Renewable energy resources- Distributed power generation- Electric power distribution- Industrial electronics- Phase locked loops- Distributed power systems- Islanding modes- Rectangular windows- Renewable energy source- Short circuit capacity- Source impedance- Unbalanced systems- Unbalanced three-phase system- Industrial electronics- Renewable energy resources;English;Conference Paper

This issue is particularly evident when different input/output operating frequencies are used, causing harmful effects on power transformers and reducing the system efficiency and power quality. Consequently, large interharmonics can be found in converters with single-phase stages, as they require large electrolytic capacitors to filter out the dc-link second harmonic of voltage and current, which is usually not fully accomplished. This is the case of the cascade multilevel converter based on single-phase power cells, where each module has a single-phase rectifier and a single-phase inverter stage that cannot be effectively decoupled with standard size capacitors. This paper shows that it is possible to improve the quality of the power cell input currents when the input/output frequencies are different in the cascade multilevel converter. This is achieved by means of magnetic couplings among the dc-links of the power cells that feed different output phases, while keeping the high power quality on the load side. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Cytology- Electric rectifiers- Electrolytic capacitors- Electromagnetic coupling- Magnetic couplings- Power electronics- Power transformers- AC-AC power conversion- Cascade multilevel converter- High power quality- Multi-level systems- Multicell- Operating frequency- Single-phase inverters- Single-phase rectifiers- Cells;English;Article

For all the three simulated cases the proposed control strategy for the PV plant was always capable to perform the VSG functions (inertial response and damping), even when one of the PV arrays output power went down to 10 %. However, simulation results also showed that in some cases the voltage variations were close to 100 % and even 300 % of its nominal value.

It is shown that, under non-uniform insolation conditions of the PV arrays, the output voltages of the cascaded inverters become unbalanced. Therefore, a dc voltage elimination control loop is proposed to balance the output voltage of the H bridges. Additionally a control technique called virtual synchronous generator (VSG) is applied to the PV plant in order to support the control of the grid frequency emulating an inertial response and providing damping and droop power. For the simulated cases the PV plant was always capable of performing the VSG functions, in spite of the unbalance condition of the output voltages of the H bridges.

The symmetric approach considers that all the power cells injects the same voltage- while the asymmetric case consists in the inclusion of two types of power cells- one of them meant for fundamental reactive power compensation and the other to cancel out the distortion power. Using steady state equations, the modulating signals of the H-bridges are calculated for a wide range of load conditions. This is used to identify when the converters lie in over-modulation and thus, the allowable operating region is found. Different values for the system parameters are considered in order to identify the compensation capabilities of both approaches.

This control strategy uses the system model to determine the optimal input that minimizes a predefined cost function. This procedure is performed by evaluating the admissible inputs of the converter model. In order to achieve a proper performance of the control strategy, a small sampling time must be used. In practice, the computational effort and processing time are critical factors that depend directly on the number of admissible states of the topology. With the objective of reducing the execution time needed by the algorithm, it is possible to take advantage of the high degree of parallelism that can be obtained from a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This paper deals with the implementation of FCS-MPC in an FPGA XC3S3500E to control a power cell of a cascaded half bridge (CHB) converter. The design is divided into subparts, called modules, which can be projected to control multiple cells using only one chip. In addition, with the aim to restrict the use of hardware to the available resources, the document presents a series of considerations related to the algorithm and its implementation. This paper presents a detailed guide with emphasis on the design and outlining of each module in order to reduce the developing times for researchers in the area of power converters. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Cascaded half-bridges- Computational effort- Control strategies- Degree of parallelism- Digital implementation- Predictive control- Predictive controller- Voltage source converters- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);English;Article

Unlike in three-phase inverters, where the Fortescue Transform or Park Transformation can be applied in order to simplify the design of the controllers, for single-phase systems they cannot be directly applied making the control a difficult task if a rotating reference frame is chosen. On the other hand, Resonant Control (RC) is a control strategy that allows working with sinusoidal references and ensuring zero steady state error. This paper studies the resonant control of a single-phase CSI in a three-phase array, considering a design in continuous as well as discrete time domain. The resonant control is justified because the current sources should not be considered equals at all times, leading to independent control in each phase, or each cell, where the current source value and the load current can be feed-forward into the controller both of them disturbances, making the load voltage control in each cell easier to accomplish. To corroborate the mathematical analysis, the proposed control scheme is tested under different conditions and disturbances, including a stability study. © 2014 IEEE.;Controllers- Industrial electronics- Resonance- Controllers- Industrial electronics- Resonance- Current source inverter- Discrete time-domain- Mathematical analysis- Park transformation- Rotating reference frame- Single-phase systems- Three-phase inverter- Zero steady state error- Independent control- Single phase current- Single phase current source inverter (CSI)- Electric inverters- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

This is because single phase inverters have been used in renewable energy, ac drives and many other applications and controlled by name ways as linear, nonlinear predictive between others. This paper studied the control of a Single-Phase Current Source Inverter (SP-CSI) for multi-cell and three-phase applications. Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB-CSI) topology is formed by the stack of SP-CSI, with all advantages that CHB implies, as modularity and commutation noise reduction. However the control for single-phase systems cannot be achieved by Park Transformation if the current load or the current source are unbalanced.

The proposed VSM entails controlling the grid-interface converter of an energy storage system (ESS) to emulate the inertial response and the damping power of a synchronous generator. In addition, self-tuning algorithms are used to continuously search for optimal parameters during the operation of the VSM in order to minimize the amplitude and rate of change of the frequency variations and the power flow through the ESS. The performances of the proposed self-tuning (ST)-VSM and the constant parameters (CP)-VSM were evaluated by comparing their inertial responses and their damping powers for different scenarios of load variations. For the simulated cases, the ST-VSM achieved a similar performance to that of the CP-VSM, while reducing the power flow through the ESS in up to 58%. Moreover, in all the simulated scenarios, the ST-VSM was found to be more efficient than the CP-VSM in attenuating frequency variations, i.e., it used less energy per Hertz reduced. © 2014 IEEE.;Damping- Electric frequency control- Energy storage- Attenuating frequencies- Autonomous power system- Dynamic frequency controls- Energy storage systems- Interface converters- Optimal controls- Self-tuning algorithms- Synchronous machine- Synchronous machinery;English;Article

Within the inverters types there are symmetric and asymmetric topologies. The asymmetric inverters have different DC voltage values. The most common topology is when the different cells are implemented in cascade arrangement, where the DC voltage are in multiples of 3, obtaining an AC voltage with 3n = 27 levels (n = 3 cascaded inverters). This topology provides a load voltage with low harmonic content, THD &lt- 3%. However, this high quality voltage has a non-negligible drawback, which is the presence of regeneration in some of the inverters, independent of load type. This phenomenon is due to the modulation technique (Nearest Level Modulation) used by this inverter. In this work, the asymmetric 15 level inverter is presented. This inverter is designed to avoid the regeneration problem - power flow from the load to the inverter - in some of the power cells. This is achieved by obtaining the firing angles associated with the power cells considering a minimum load voltage THD. Finally, a power flow analysis is accomplished and simulated results show the feasibility of this approach. © 2013 IEEE.;Cascaded inverters- DC-AC converter- Medium voltage- Modulation techniques- Multilevel inverter- New modulation- Power flow analysis- Simulated results- Frequency modulation- Industrial electronics- Topology- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

The proposed current control strategy is based on a prediction calculation to select the switching states of the converter. By using a predictive cost function, the optimal switching state to be applied to the next sampling time is selected.

The proposed configuration has similar advantages as the classic voltage source CHB as the use of semiconductors with lower voltage rating with respect to the load voltage. Moreover the CSI-CHB load voltage has a smaller distortion than the classic CHB due to the first order capacitive filter used at the inverters AC side. Also, the use of modulation techniques as phased-shifted carrier sinusoidal pulse modulation (PSC-SPWM) allows both, reduce the capacitive filter size and reduce the commutation frequency of the inverter switches.

The cascaded multilevel inverters derive from high voltage, high power quality and high reliability requirements in both development alternatives. Up to now, the cascaded multilevel converters have been implemented using voltage source power cells. However, they can also be implemented using current source units. One factor against CSIs is the large size of the inductive filters needed in the DC links, especially when single-phase inverters are considered. This paper presents a current-source cascaded multilevel converter (CS-CMC), based on single-phase power cells and their implementation alternatives, which enable a reduction in the sizes of the DC-link inductors. It is demonstrated that these sizes can be reduced using magnetic couplings between the DC links of the power cells. These magnetic couplings can eliminate second harmonic currents, as well as other even harmonics of current in the DC link of the power cells. This work asserts that the implementation of a current-source cascaded multilevel converter, based on single-phase power cells, must consider magnetic couplings between its DC links. Design results and the simulation of a development alternative of the system, aim to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the cascaded multilevel converter. © 2013 IEEE.;Cascaded multi-level inverters- Cascaded multilevel converter- Current source converters- Current source inverter- Medium voltage motor- Single-phase inverters- Single-phase power- Voltage source inverter- Cells- Industrial electronics- Magnetic couplings- Cytology;English;Conference Paper

MCSCs are built by stacking parallel current source converters. Two advantages that make MCSCs attractive are: (a) extended current/voltage ratings beyond the device ratings and (b) simplicity in balancing the DC link current in each module. This can be accomplished using two optimized modulating patterns that have been proposed for such topologies: (a) multilevel selective harmonic elimination (MSHE) and (b) displaced selective harmonic elimination (DSHE). Both techniques are based on SHE patterns but there are slight differences in their digital implementation due to the way they generate the harmonic cancellation. Furthermore, when these techniques are used in the rectifier stage, it is reported that MSHE and DSHE do not eliminate all the unwanted harmonics due to practical issues such as changes in the modulating indexes to control the DC link currents. This work compares the operation of DSHE and MSHE when used in rectifiers of an MCSC in terms of execution time, robustness to poor sampling frequency, and quality of harmonic profiles on AC input currents under different operating conditions. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical considerations. © 2012 IEEE.;AC drives- Different operating conditions- Digital control- Digital implementation- Harmonic cancellation- Parallel currents- Sampling frequencies- Selective harmonic elimination- AC motors- Digital control systems- Harmonic analysis- Pulse width modulation- Electric rectifiers;English;Article

This type of converter has a multi-pulse transformer which performs the cancellation of the low frequency harmonics generated by the three-phase diode rectifiers. Despite this advantage, the multi-pulse transformer is bulky, heavy, expensive, and must be designed according to the number of power cells, making the transformer topology dependent. This work proposes to reduce the complexity of the transformer in multi-cell converters using Active Front End rectifiers in combination with a Finite Control Set - Model Predictive Control strategy.

This paper presents a systematic comparison between these two technologies, depicting the main advantages and drawbacks of each one. Key programming and implementation aspects are addressed in order to give an overall idea of their most important features and allow the comparison between DSP and FPGA devices. A classical linear control strategy for a well-known voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based topology used as Static Compensator (STATCOM) is considered as a driving example to evaluate the performance of both approaches. A proof-of-concept laboratory prototype is separately controlled with the TMS320F2812 DSP and the Spartan-3 XCS1000 FPGA to illustrate the characteristics of both technologies. In the case of the DSP, a virtual floating-point library is used to accelerate the control routines compared to double precision arithmetic. On the other hand, two approaches are developed for the FPGA implementation, the first one reduces the hardware utilization and the second one reduces the computation time. Even though both boards can successfully control the STATCOM, results show that the FPGA achieves the best computation time thanks to the high degree of parallelism available on the device. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;Degree of parallelism- Digital control- Digital signal processors (DSP)- Hardware utilization- Implementation aspects- Performance comparison- Static compensator- Voltage source converters- Digital arithmetic- Digital control systems- Digital libraries- Digital signal processors- Electric current regulators- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Linear control systems- Synchronous machinery- Digital signal processing;English;Article

The algorithm requires defining a functional in order to optimize it and thus find the best switch combination. So far the functional optimizes either the steady state or the transient operation. In fact, for steady state operation, the minimization of the switching frequency as well as high quality waveforms are the basic objectives. Contrary, during transient conditions the settling time minimization is usually used as a basic objective. This work presents an algorithm that is able to detect if the system is either under steady state or transient operating mode and applies the appropriate control algorithm. Hence, both operating modes are controlled under optimum conditions.

Successful application to different topologies and applications such as two-level voltage source inverters, neutral-point-clamped and cascaded H-bridge inverters, and matrix converters has shown its potential in power converters. However, when multiple control objectives are desired, weighting factors are required to appropriately select the switching states. The selection of these factors is a time-consuming and complex task. In this work, the standard selection stage is replaced by a fuzzy decision-making strategy, considering, as a case study, the control of both load and supply currents in the direct matrix converter (DMC). As a result, weighting-factor selection is avoided, and a simple selection scheme is obtained for this application. In addition, a more natural design approach to the state selection is opened for other applications. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the approach in an experimental DMC prototype. © 2012 IEEE.;Bridge circuits- Control systems- Decision making- Digital control systems- Electric current control- Electric inverters- Fuzzy logic- Model predictive control- Power converters- AC-AC power conversion- Cascaded H-bridge inverters- Complex task- Control objectives- Digital control- Fuzzy decision-making- Matrix converter- Multi objective- Natural design- Predictive control- Selection scheme- Selection stages- State selection- State selectors- Supply currents- Voltage source inverter- Weighting factors- Predictive control systems;English;Article

The main disadvantage of this configuration is the bulky DC inductor required in each cell which must be designed in order to compensate the oscillating power drained by the single-phase inverter. In order to avoid the use of a large DC inductor, the use of magnetic couplings among DC links of different power cells is considered. Additionally, active front end rectifiers are used in order to control the DC current and ensure a unitary displacement power factor in each power cell. A control scheme based on non-linear controllers is proposed in order to control each cell in a decoupled way. The topology feasibility is tested experimentally, while the control scheme performance is tested by simulation, showing that it is possible to obtain an excellent overall input current quality and a load voltage with lesser dv/dt than the classic multi-cell topology, reducing the requiered DC inductor from 400 mH to 30 mH for the studied case. © 2013 IEEE.;Active front end rectifiers- Current source inverter- Current-source converters- Displacement power factor- Input current qualities- Non linear control- Non-linear controllers- Single-phase inverters- Bridge circuits- Cells- Cytology- Electric inverters- Industrial electronics- Linear control systems- Magnetic couplings- Topology- Quality control;English;Conference Paper

This work studies a predictive control scheme for power converters that are directly connected to the AC network featuring large frequency variations. The proposed scheme considers a fixed number of samples per period independent of the network frequency, leading to a variable sampling time under varying frequency conditions. This feature is advantageous when frequency has an important operating range because it ensures a constant resolution of the measured system variables. As discrete predictive control requires the sampling time to make accurate predictions, a synchronization system is proposed that ensures a fixed number of samples per cycle through continuous adjustment of the sampling time. Simulations show good performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.;Accurate prediction- Frequency variation- Network frequency- Power generation sources- Predictive control- Static power converters- Synchronization systems- Wide frequency range- Electric power distribution- Power converters- Industrial electronics;English;Conference Paper

The method is based on the discrete prediction model of the system, including the converter and output filter. The model is used to predict how the system variables will behave for each switching state of the converter. The predictions are evaluated using a cost function that weights the level of accomplishment of the control goals. The switching state with the best performance is then generated. The proposed algorithm predicts the output currents (including the output filter capacitors), ensuring sinusoidal current generation without the need for cascaded control loops, coordinate transformations, and modulation schemes found in traditional solutions. In addition, low switching frequency is imposed by including a new term in the cost function. Simulation results validate the proposed control scheme, with performance comparable to the traditional solutions, especially in terms of the current and voltage harmonic distortion. © 2013 IEEE.;Current source inverter- Digital control- Discrete-time signals- Power drives- Predictive control- Cost functions- Digital control systems- Drives- Electric current control- Electrical engineering- Predictive control systems- Active filters;English;Conference Paper

The method allows flexible control schemes with fast dynamics. However, the standard formulation of this type of controllers is based on a minimization of a single cost function. This optimization method requires weighting factors that depend on the system parameters and operating point. The calculation of these factors is achieved through a nontrivial process. In this paper, a predictive torque and flux control of an induction machine drive fed by a three-phase two-level voltage source inverter is developed. The proposed strategy replaces the single cost function with a multiobjective optimization based on a ranking approach. This approach makes the tuning of weighting factors unnecessary for a correct operation. Simulation and experimental results on steady state and dynamic operation are presented to illustrate the good behavior of the drive. © 2012 IEEE.;Cost functions- Model predictive control- Multiobjective optimization- Dynamic operations- Fast dynamics- Finite control set- Flexible control- Flux control- Induction machine drive- Operating points- Optimization method- Predictive control- Ranking approach- Steady state- Voltage source inverter- Weighting factors- Predictive control systems;English;Article

Considering a voltage DC ratio 1: 3: 9 for three inverters connected in series an AC voltage featuring 27 levels is obtained. The most common modulation used in asymmetric inverters is the Nearest Level Modulation (NLM) which has the drawback of bringing some cells into regeneration for some values of the modulation index, regardless of the load conditions. This paper presents a new modulation strategy for this asymmetric inverter that forces all the cell to have identical power flow direction. This strategy is based on the fact that the fundamental voltage amplitude of each inverter is required to be always greater than or equal to zero.

Using controlled rectifiers to provide an output current following a reference increase those losses. An approach proposed in several works uses multi stage converters connected in cascade, where an AC/AC frequency changer is connected to an AC/DC diode based converter across a high frequency magnetic link. The AC/AC converter connected to the ac mains voltage boosts the frequency and provides control on the current delivered to the load. The DC converter delivers the output current at the load voltage.

The control scheme selects the switching state that minimizes the error in the torque and flux predictions according to their reference values. At the same time, the control scheme is enhanced by including an instantaneous reactive power minimization strategy with the goal of achieving unity displacement power factor on the input side of the converter. Through the simulation results it is shown that the predictive approach can be implemented simply with a good tracking of the torque and flux to their respective references and input currents with almost unity power factor.

The multi-variable, nonlinear, and coupled features of these topologies make the control strategy design a difficult task. Controlling this kind of system with single-variable linear controllers-as proposed in this work-presents significant advantages compared with other approaches as simplicity in the design steps due to the large amount of tools developed for this kind of schemes. Particularly, a classic design method based on the root locus approach is used to choose the controllers parameters in order to achieve a given dynamical behavior. Compensation of reactive power and fundamental frequency disturbances is presented in this paper as part of a general control strategy for multilevel active power filters. The proposed control strategy is implemented on the TMS320C6713 DSP-based system for a low-power laboratory prototype, and thus the controllers design is carried out on the discrete-time and -frequency domain. Also, due to the inherent asymmetries among the power cells in a modular topology, a dedicated local control strategy is proposed to ensure a symmetrical distribution of the power among the power cells. This feature allows the semiconductor devices of each module to operate under the same voltage and current ratings. Simulated and experimental results showing stationary and transient conditions demonstrate the feasibility of the control scheme. © 2012 IEEE.;Controllers- Design- Discrete time control systems- Frequency domain analysis- Linear control systems- Power quality- Root loci- Semiconductor devices- Topology- Active power Filter- Dynamical behaviors- Fundamental frequencies- Linear controls- Local control strategies- Multilevel power converters- Transient conditions- Unified power quality conditioners- Quality control;English;Article

In this work, a control scheme is proposed in order to compensate the oscillating power, avoiding to oversize the DC reactor at the expense of increasing the distortion of the input currents in each power cell and the instantaneous peak of the modulation index. However, the overall input currents present very low distortion and the instantaneous peak of the modulation index can be reduced by properly designing the multi-pulse transformer in terms of voltage ratio and phase shift. Both, the input currents distortion and the effect in the modulation index are mathematically characterized.

This requires the use of a large DC link capacitor in order to minimize the DC link voltage ripple. Instead, this paper proposes a control scheme based on predictive control aimed to compensate the oscillatory power that allows the design of the DC link capacitor without oversizing it. However, this is achieved at expense of much distorted AC supply currents and amplified modulating signals.

Eng., Ryerson University, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada- Department of Electrical Eng., Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile;This paper presents a novel model predictive control method for current source converters (CSC) following the duality with voltage source converters (VSC). In VSC the predictive control is applied to the output current, while in this work the CSC is controlled through the output voltage. The method is based on the discrete prediction model of the system, including the converter and output filter. The model is used to predict future behavior of the system variables for each switching state of the converter. The predictions are evaluated in a cost function that weights the level of accomplishment of the control goals. The switching state with best performance is then generated. The proposed algorithm predicts the output terminal voltages (includes the output filter capacitors), ensuring sinusoidal voltage generation without the need of cascaded control loops, coordinate transformations and modulation schemes found in classic solutions. In addition, low switching frequency is imposed by including the switching frequency in the cost function. Simulation results show a preliminary validation of the proposed control scheme, with comparable performance to the classical solutions, especially in terms of the current and voltage harmonic distortion. © 2012 IEEE.;Classical solutions- Co-ordinate transformation- Control goals- Control loop- Control schemes- Current source converters- Low switching frequency- Modulation schemes- Output current- Output filters- Output voltages- Prediction model- Predictive control- Sinusoidal voltage- System variables- Terminal voltages- Voltage harmonic distortion- Voltage source converters- Active filters- Cost functions- Industrial electronics- Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems;English;Conference Paper

If the filtering out is not strictly performed, the AC input current of each module is affected with the appearance of non-characteristic harmonics, sub-harmonics or inter-harmonics- thus, the RMS currents in the multi-pulse transformer secondaries increases. This problem may become even more evident if the converter output frequency is lower than the AC mains frequency, because the capacitor presents higher impedance at low frequency, causing that part of the harmonic currents demanded by the inverter is supplied directly by the rectifier. This paper presents an alternative to eliminate the unexpected harmonics and thus reduce the RMS values of the power cells input current in cascaded multilevel converters. The proposed solution uses magnetic couplings between the power modules of the converter- such approach is presented as a low cost solution compared to the conventional oversized DC-link capacitors. © 2012 IEEE.;AC input- AC/DC/AC converter- Cascaded multilevel converter- Dc link capacitor- DC links- H-bridges- Harmonic currents- Input current- Inter-harmonics- Low-cost solution- Multipulses- Non-characteristic harmonics- Output frequency- Power cells- Power module- Second harmonics- Single-phase inverters- Subharmonics- Transformer secondaries- Capacitors- Electric rectifiers- Industrial electronics- Magnetic couplings- Pulse transformers- Harmonic analysis;English;Conference Paper

España 1680, Valparaíso, Chile;The finite states model predictive control is a promising alternative in the field of the control of power converters. Its characteristics allow simple and flexible control schemes with fast dynamics. However, the standard formulation of this type of controllers, which is based on an aggregated cost function, requires suitable weighting factors for an adequate switching state selection. The specification of these factors depend on various parameters making it a non trivial process. In this work, an alternative is proposed that replaces the standard aggregated cost function with a fuzzy decision making strategy. This strategy retains the multiple attribute nature of the state selection. As a result, the possibility of a more natural and higher level design approach to the state selection process is opened. To introduce the technique, only objectives with equal importance are considered. Simulation results are presented to illustrate and validate the approach using the control of output and input currents in the Direct Matrix Converter. © 2011 IEEE.;AC-AC power conversion- Digital control- Fast dynamics- Flexible control- Fuzzy Decision making- Input current- Level design- Matrix converter- Multiple attributes- Non-trivial- Predictive control- State selection- Weighting factors- Control systems- Cost functions- Decision making- Digital control systems- Electric current control- Industrial electronics- Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Fuzzy logic;English;Conference Paper

The UPQC is a back-to-back connection of active filters- combining a shunt and a series topology but maintaining the features of both units, where the main objective is to improve the power quality. The multivariable, nonlinear and coupled nature of the UPQC makes the control a difficult task. In this work, a discrete nonlinear control of a multilevel UPQC based on Single-Phase power cells is proposed, where the controlled variables are decoupled to improve both dynamic and static system responses. In this scheme, two different Park Transforms are used to conveniently synchronize each compensator allowing a dedicated control regulator for every output variable.

Current sub- and inter-harmonics affect the operation of power transformers, causing a reduction in the system efficiency and power quality. Inter-harmonics can be very evident in converters with single-phase stages, as they require large capacitors to filter out the voltage and current second harmonic present in the DC links, which usually is not fully mitigated. This is the case of the cascade multilevel converter based on single-phase power cells, where each power cell has a single-phase rectifier and a single-phase inverter that become not totally decoupled with standard size capacitors. This paper shows that it is possible to improve the quality of the input currents of such power cells even when the input/output frequencies are different. This is achieved by means of magnetic couplings among the DC links of the power cells that feed different output phases. © 2011 IEEE.;AC/DC/AC converter- Cascade multilevel converter- DC links- DC-link filters- Improving power- Input current- Input/output- Inter-harmonics- Line currents- Non-regenerative- Operating frequency- Power cells- Second harmonics- Single-phase inverters- Single-phase power- Single-phase rectifiers- Standard size- Subharmonics- System efficiency- Cells- DC power transmission- Electric converters- Harmonic analysis- Industrial electronics- Magnetic couplings- Paper capacitors- Power quality- Power transformers- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

Differently to configurations based on symmetrical units, the proposed structure is assembled using one type of power cells for compensating reactive power at fundamental frequency and another kind of power cells for compensating harmonic currents. Hence, high power - slow semiconductors can be used in power cells to compensate reactive power at fundamental frequency using low switching frequencies and the harmonic compensation is done using power cells that feature low power - faster semiconductors commutated at high frequencies. Thus, the functionality and overall efficiency can be improved while keeping the modularity feature. Moreover, this approach allows decoupling the control objectives and thus, using the superposition principle, independent control strategies can be designed. Additionally, the power cells considered for harmonic compensation can be self adjusted as the load conditions change in order to operate at minimal DC voltage.

The active damping is used to suppress the resonance of the input filter.

The control method selects the best commutation state, according to an optimizing algorithm and a cost function, in order to generate unity input displacement power factor with high-quality waveforms. The active damping method is based on a virtual harmonic resistor that damps the filter resonance. This paper shows simulated and experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed control method can generate good tracking of the output current references, achieve unity input displacement power factor, and reduce the input current distortion caused by the input filter resonance. © 2011 IEEE.;AC-AC power conversion- Digital control- Discrete-time signals- Power system modeling- Predictive control- Control systems- Damping- Digital control systems- Electric power factor- Harmonic distortion- Power converters- Reactive power- Resonance- Active filters;English;Article

The resulting topology has the characteristics of both filters and can compensate voltage and currents disturbances and improve the customer's power quality. The topology based on current source converters (CSC-UPQC) has a good dynamic behavior to mitigate voltage disturbances as it uses a first order filter in the series stage. This allows a rapid response while using low switching frequencies without the problems associated with the resonance of the second order filter as required in the voltage source topology.

The topology is characterized by its reduced size and weight compared to Voltage Source Inverters because there is no DC link stage. Recently, diverse control methods have been proposed for the direct matrix converter. In particular, the finite states model predictive control (FS-MPC) gives a valid alternative for the control of this converter. However, the determination of the control parameters or weighting factors used in the traditional schemes has not been possible to treat systematically. In this work, a novel method for searching and determining the optimum state to apply is proposed that does not require weighting factors. This method uses ideas from multiobjective optimization theory and is based on obtaining a ranking of each possible solution respect to the rest of the solutions, eliminating the use of weighting factors.

The multi-variable, non-linear, and coupled features of these topologies make the control strategy design a difficult task. Controlling this kind of systems with mono-variable linear controllers - as proposed in this work - presents significant advantages compared with other approaches as simplicity in the design steps due to the large amount of tools developed for this kind of schemes. Particularly, a classic design method based on the Root Locus approach is used to choose the controllers parameters in order to achieve a given dynamical behavior. The proposed control strategy in this work is intended to be implemented on a DSP based system and thus its design is carried out on the discrete-time and -frequency domain. Also, due to the inherent asymmetries among the power cells in a modular topology, a dedicated individual control strategy is included to ensure a symmetrical distribution of the power among the power cells. This feature allows the semiconductor devices of each corresponding module to operate under the same voltage and current ratings. Results showing transient conditions are shown to probe the feasibility of the control scheme. © 2010 IEEE.;Classic design- Control schemes- Control strategies- Current rating- Design steps- Discrete-time- DSP based systems- Dynamical behaviors- Frequency domains- Individual control- Linear controllers- Linear controls- Modular topologies- Multi variables- Non-linear- Power cells- Single-phase power- Transient conditions- Unified power quality conditioners- Behavioral research- Controllers- Design- Industrial electronics- Linear control systems- Root loci- Semiconductor device manufacture- Semiconductor devices- Topology- Discrete time control systems;English;Conference Paper

Choosing the AFE implies to use optimized switching patterns in both, rectifiers and inverters. Several authors propose modular current source based AC-Drives (MCSC) as a practical way to handle currents larger than the devices capabilities. Standard SHE was extended to Multilevel Selective Harmonic Elimination (MSHE) for MCSC. MSHE change the harmonic spectra by subtracting the larger harmonics of the total current pattern. It results in cleaner multilevel patterns. This is not the case if symmetrical modulation indexes and balanced currents are not ensured. The inverters shape the output line current meanwhile the rectifiers independently balance the DC currents. Thus, the possibility of having rectifiers operating at asymmetrical conditions exists which generates a threat of harmonic pollution. An alternative approach to generate multilevel patterns in the rectifier stage of MCSC considers the use of Displaced SHE patterns (DSHE). This approach provides total elimination for low order harmonics as well as a reduction of the characteristic harmonics amplitude reducing the total distortion. This work presents the mathematical bases of the DSHE operation. Additionally, it compares the SHE, MSHE, and DSHE for the rectifiers of an MCSC. Simulated results validate the theoretical considerations. © 2010 IEEE.;AC drives- Active front ends- Alternative approach- Controlled rectifier- Dc current- Harmonic mitigation- Harmonic pollution- Harmonic spectrum- Harmonics amplitude- High power applications- Large current- Low order harmonics- Mathematical basis- Modular currents- Modulation indexes- Multi-level pattern- Output lines- Rectifier stage- Selective harmonic elimination- Simulated results- Switching patterns- Total current- Total distortion- AC motors- DC power transmission- Drives- Harmonic analysis- Industrial electronics- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

The UPQC works in a three-phase four-wire electrical system in order to compensate for nonlinear and asymmetrical loads, and disturbances in the power supply voltage. For the generation of reference currents for the FLFB the instantaneous power theory in the dqz reference frame is used. The FLFB inverter is modulated using the 3D-SVM (3D-Space Vector Modulation) algorithm to generate the positive, negative and zero sequence voltages required. Finally, PI (Proportional-Integral) controllers are used to adjust the steady state error of the controlled signals in the shunt and series compensator. Simulation results show that when a nonlinear and asymmetrical load is compensated with the proposed UPQC topology and control scheme, unitary power factor, sinusoidal currents and neutral current mitigation can be achieved at the PCC (Point Common Coupling), all of this with constant rms voltage at the load side, independently of the PCC voltage disturbances. As an example, a simulation study is performed in this work obtaining a reduction from 29% to 1.9% in PCC current THD, a reduction from 52.8 (A rms) to 3.4 (A rms) in PCC neutral current, and a 1.3% variation in rms load voltage when a 10% sag occurred in PCC side. © 2010 IEEE.;Common coupling- Control schemes- D-space- Electrical systems- Four-leg- Full-bridge- Instantaneous power theory- Load voltages- Neutral currents- Power supply voltage- Proportional-integral- Reference currents- Reference frame- Series compensator- Shunt active filters- Simulation result- Simulation studies- Sinusoidal currents- Steady state errors- Three-phase four-wire- Unified power quality conditioners- Unitary power factor- Voltage disturbances- Zero sequence voltage- Active filters- Electric fault currents- Electric power factor correction- Electric power systems- Industrial electronics- Three dimensional- Vector spaces- Quality control;English;Conference Paper

Minera Esperanza, Vitacura 2670, Las Condes Santiago, Chile;This paper presents a filter scheme composed by passive and series active power filters specially designed to compensate fundamental reactive power (with passive filters) and current harmonics (combination of passive and active). Low frequency current sub and inter-harmonics generated by cycloconverters are eliminated with an active power filter connected in series to a C type passive filter. Current frequency harmonics associated with cycloconverter topology are eliminated with passive filter units. With the proposed filter topology compensation effectiveness is significantly improved and allows the elimination of passive filter units, reducing cost and space required as compared with traditional passive schemes. This paper presents the principles of operation and design requirements of the proposed hybrid filter scheme.

The procedure is based on the fact that the load and distributor operating conditions range are known and it is required to impose stiff operating conditions in both the load side (regulation) and the point of common coupling side (power factor). Due to the arbitrary number of cells to be used in a modular approach, the proposed design procedure allows to select the power semiconductors and capacitors based on an economical evaluation, so an optimal number of cells can be chosen to minimize the overall power cell cost. This design procedure is well suited for modular configurations, where several degrees of freedom are not covered if just technical criteria are followed. Thus, an economic approach can be used to select the appropriate components. The rest of the devices, i.e., the transformers turn ratio and passive filters, are chosen using classical design methods based on technical issues such that the power cells operate within its permissible ratings. A practical case evaluation is presented for a medium voltage system application. © 2009 IEEE.;Arbitrary number- Degrees of freedom- Design method- Design procedure- Economic approach- Economical analysis- Economical evaluation- Medium voltage- Modular approach- Modular configurations- Operating condition- Optimal number- Point of common coupling- Power cells- Power device economics- Power factors- Power semiconductors- Unified power-quality conditioner (UPQC)- Cell membranes- Design- Electric equipment- Electric measuring instruments- Electric power factor- Passive filters- Power electronics- Wireless telecommunication systems- Power transformers;English;Article

Particularly, if the topology is used in systems that are connected to an unbalanced AC network and/or feeds an unbalanced load. The topology in combination with the proposed arrange of the power cells and the multi-pulse transformer becomes best suitable for applications where the quality of the voltage and current waveforms are of main concern. In fact, the topology minimizes the problems produced by unbalanced loads even though the single-phase nature of both the input and output of the power cells. Moreover, the proposed arrange acts as a buffer for the AC mains voltage unbalances as they do not have any effect on the load voltages.

Differently to topologies based on symmetrical units, the proposed topology is assembled using one type of single-phase power cells for compensating disturbances at the fundamental frequency and another type for compensating harmonic currents. This feature allows the implementation of the power cells with different types of semiconductors, so the cells that compensate at the fundamental frequency can use slower semiconductors but with higher voltage/current ratings and the power cells that compensate harmonics can use faster semiconductors but with lower voltage/current ratings. In addition, as the control objectives of the two types of cells are different, two control schemes are designed to operate independently. Particularly, power cells for harmonic compensation can dynamically adjust its own DC voltage to follow the load conditions in order to operate with maximum efficiency. Simulated preliminary results confirm the theoretical considerations. © 2008 IEEE.;Crystals- Electric conductivity- Harmonic analysis- Industrial electronics- Natural frequencies- Semiconductor materials- Control objectives- Control schemes- Dc voltages- Fundamental frequencies- Harmonic cancellations- Harmonic compensations- Harmonic currents- Load conditions- Maximum efficiencies- Modular approaches- Multi cells- Power cells- Single-phase power- Unified power quality conditioners- Cells;English;Conference Paper

The topology is mainly the dual of the conventional topology based on voltage-source power cells. As such, it inherits all the advantages of the standard topology. But more importantly, the second current harmonic injected back by the normal operation of the single-phase current-source inverters are naturally cancelled out at the DC side of the power cells. This feature is assured by sharing the same magnetic circuit among the inverters connected to different load phases. As a result, the DC link filter required by the operation of the cell needs to be designed just to filter out the switching harmonics. Differently to voltage-source power cells based N-level converters, this ensures a small filter size, an important feature for medium to high power applications. Moreover, standard modulating techniques can be used such as SPWM, space vector"" and Selective Harmonic Elimination without any penalties on the aforementioned advantages.

The proposed algorithm includes a multiplier, a filter, a feedback closed loop, and a numerically controlled oscillator stage. As a result, a discrete sine (and cosine) signal is generated in synchronism with the fundamental component of an external-reference (ER) signal. Moreover, the sampling period of the algorithm is adjusted at each sampling instant such that an integer number of sampling periods per period of the ER signal is ensured. This is the main feature, and it is achieved by using a discrete rectangular window filter and a discrete controller. The proposed algorithm code is simple, stable, and presents high noise rejection.

However, it is sensitive to polluted AC supplies because no storing elements are present and thus any disturbance would reach the load terminals. Typical disturbances in the AC distribution systems are voltage unbalances, sags, swells, and 5th &amp- 7th voltage harmonics are also found when nonlinear loads are present in the distribution system. This paper presents a comparison between a classical control strategy such as Venturini modulation with linear current controllers and a proposed predictive control approach for the load currents.

Standard low power ASDs are based on a rectifier, a voltage DC link, and an inverter. The selection of an ASD depends upon the voltage and power rating of the load. For low power levels there are standard topologies that use standard semiconductors and thus with high availability and low cost. However, for high power rating, the ASD is mostly a more sophisticated power topology. Recent approaches include NPC, multi-cell, and H-bridge base topologies. This work proposes to stack standard low power ASDs to achieve higher operating power levels.

Particularly, it uses a predictive approach in combination with a linear PI controller. The predictive portion takes care of the non-linear, multi-variable, and coupled behavior of the topology. This is possible due to the limited number of valid positions of the switches and the deterministic model of the structure that allows the representation by means of a discrete algorithm. However, parameter variations and the includible approximations of the discrete model, makes the overall performance far from being the optimum expected in both dynamic and static conditions. This justifies the use of the additional linear PI controller in order to operate with zero steady state error. The resulting system becomes a hybrid approach and the results show an easy strategy to be implemented in a digital system with high overall performance. ©2008 IEEE.;Electric power factor- Power electronics- Rectifying circuits- Active Power- Deterministic modeling- Digital systems- Discrete algorithms- Discrete modeling- Displacement power factor- Hybrid approaches- Hybrid control- Hybrid control strategies- Non-linear- Overall performance- Parameter variations- Phase currents- PI controllers- Static conditions- Three-phase rectifiers- Zero steady-state error- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

Linear and nonlinear control schemes are compared in terms of system modeling, dynamic response, signal tracking, stability, and implementation. Mathematical, analytical, and practical simulation results demonstrate that nonlinear control allows a better compensation performance under transient and steady state operating conditions. The implemented nonlinear scheme is a passivity based control (PBC), whereas the linear control is implemented with the traditional PI. This paper validates that the passivity based nonlinear control is a better and feasible alternative for converter applications, especially when fast dynamic response, zero steady state error, changes of operating points, no overshoots on the controlled signal, and an easy implementation are required. The application on dynamic voltage restorers can be extended to other active compensation equipment implemented with static converters. ©2008 IEEE.;Dynamic response- Electric fault currents- Linear control systems- Passivation- Power electronics- Semiconductor device models- System stability- Voltage regulators- Active compensation- Compensation performance- Control techniques- Dynamic voltage restorer- Dynamic voltage restorers- Linear controls- Non-linear control- Operating points- Passivity based- Passivity-Based Control- Signal tracking- Simulation results- Steady-state operating conditions- System modelling- Zero steady-state error- Control system stability;English;Conference Paper

The strategy features the advantages of the Direct Torque Control and the Predictive Control, verifying its robustness through out the analysis of its behavior under an unbalanced AC supply. The high performance of the predictive control is based on the deterministic model of the converter-machine system. Such model is used to predict at any given sampling time the future values of the electrical variables as a function of the switch status. A functional is then optimized and the optimum switch status is thus selected. The optimum selection ensures unitary input power factor and zero steady state error in the flux and torque of the AC machine. The speed is adjusted by a closed loop scheme and the unbalance is naturally mitigated. Several simulations showing the transient and steady state behavior of the proposed scheme are presented. © 2007 IEEE.;Matrix converters- Model predictive control- Torque control- Deterministic modeling- Direct torque control- Input power factor- Optimum selection- Predictive control- Steady-state behaviors- Time discrete control- Zero steady state error- AC machinery;English;Conference Paper

The work identifies the causes for the phenomena and proposes a control strategy to mitigate it. The strategy is conceived for carrier-based modulating techniques. Specifically, the middle point of the carriers is used to produce a zero current sequence that is used to balance the DC link voltages. An interesting outcome is the mathematical justification for using either the series or the parallel converter to control the unbalance as a function of the operating point of the system. As a result, the UPQC can keep the load voltage and PCC power factor while the DC link voltage unbalance is minimized even during transient conditions at both the PCC voltage level and load level. Simulated preliminary results are used to probe the theoretical considerations. © 2007 IEEE.;Arsenic compounds- Civil aviation- Electric power factor- Annual meetings- Balance (weighting)- Carrier (CO)- Control strategies- Converters (Paper Industry)- DC-link voltages- Load levelling- Load voltages- Mathematical justification- Modulating techniques- Neutral point clamping- Operating points- Parallel converters- Power factor (PF)- Transient conditions- Voltage levels- Zero currents- Electric fault currents;English;Conference Paper

The study shows that the topology naturally compensates most of the voltage unbalance- for instance, for a 100% voltage unbalance in the ac mains, just 32% reaches the load. For critical applications, a feedforward control technique is proposed in order to compensate the remaining unbalance at the load side. The resulting topology, in combination with the proposed strategy, reduces near to zero the load fundamental voltage unbalance, while the input current unbalance and distortion are also improved.

The operating principle of the proposed algorithm includes a multiplier, a filter, a feedback closed loop, and a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) stage. As a result, a discrete sine (and cosine) signal is generated in perfect synchronism with the fundamental component of an external reference signal. Moreover, the sampling period of the algorithm is adjusted at each sampling instant such that an integer number of sampling periods is ensured per period of the external reference signal.

In order to work with a simplified but still accurate model, a representation in a rotating reference frame dq0 in combination with an average model are normally used. The result is a model that operates with ripple free inputs, outputs, and state variables that should be the accurate average value of the actual variables. However, the average model of these topologies could lead to errors if damping resistors are used. A case study shows as much as 10% error in the DC link current between the actual value and the predicted by the average model. This paper finds and shows systematically the source of the error and proposes a method for the accurate average modeling of CSRs with damping resistors.

One commonly-used approach is to treat each genome as a set of k-mers and to compute the Jaccard coefficient between each genome pair. However, computing the Jaccard coefficient between genomes in a large dataset is a computationally-challenging task. In this paper, we present an algorithm and accelerator architecture that uses an FPGA-as-a-service paradigm to compute the Jaccard similarity between pairs of genomes in large datasets using sketches and hardware acceleration in the cloud. The algorithm can compute the similarity between all genome pairs in the dataset, or it can use a selection criterion to reduce the amount of computation when only genome pairs with a Jaccard coefficient above a user-supplied threshold are of interest. After building the sketches, our heterogeneous accelerator can compute more than 96 million Jaccard coefficients per second running on an AWS EC2 f1.2xlarge instance with a Xilinx XCVU9P FPGA, which is 58 times faster than a state-of-the art software implementation that exploits SIMD instructions and thread-level parallelism on a compute-optimized EC2 c5.9xlarge instance with 36 hardware threads. The accelerator also computes similarities 27 times faster than a straightforward GPU-accelerated implementation of the Jaccard coefficient using sketches, and 4 times faster than an optimized GPU implementation of our algorithm, both running on an EC2 g5.4xlarge instance tailored with an NVIDIA A10G GPU. Furthermore, using a Jaccard coefficient threshold of 0.8 reduces the execution time of similarity computation to approximately one third in the hardware-accelerated and parallel software implementations, compared to computing the complete similarity matrix. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Acceleration- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Genes- Large dataset- Cloud-computing- Field programmables- Field-programmable gate array- Genomics- Hardware acceleration- Jaccard coefficients- Large datasets- Programmable gate array- Sketch- Streaming algorithm- Genome;English;Article

However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases. Results for deterministic and probabilistic tractography data show high reproducibility, especially for probabilistic tractography in HCP data. In comparison to previous work, our atlas features a higher number of bundles and greater cortical surface coverage. © 2022;adult- article- connectome- controlled study- female- hierarchical clustering- human- human experiment- major clinical study- male- reproducibility- tractography- white matter- brain- cluster analysis- diagnostic imaging- image processing- procedures- Brain- Cluster Analysis- Connectome- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Reproducibility of Results- White Matter;English;Article

However, inference is a computationally-intensive process that often requires hardware acceleration to operate in real time. For mobile devices, the power consumption of graphics processors (GPUs) is frequently prohibitive, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) become a solution to perform inference at high speed. Although previous works have implemented CNN inference on FPGAs, their high utilization of on-chip memory and arithmetic resources complicate their application on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we present a scalable, low power, low resource-utilization accelerator architecture for inference on the MobileNet V2 CNN. The architecture uses a heterogeneous system with an embedded processor as the main controller, external memory to store network data, and dedicated hardware implemented on reconfigurable logic with a scalable number of processing elements (PE). Implemented on a XCZU7EV FPGA running at 200 MHz and using four PEs, the accelerator infers with 87% top-5 accuracy and processes an image of 224 × 224 pixels in 220 ms. It consumes 7.35 W of power and uses less than 30% of the logic and arithmetic resources used by other MobileNet FPGA accelerators. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the exact computation of the entropy in high-speed networks is a difficult process due to the limited memory resources available in the data plane hardware. In this paper, we present a method and hardware accelerator to approximate the empirical entropy of a large data set with high throughput and sublinear memory requirements. Our method uses streaming algorithms that exploit the fine-grained parallelism of existing hardware platforms for data plane processing, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The method uses sketches to compute the cardinality of the stream and the frequencies of the top-K elements on line, and then it estimates the contribution to the entropy of the rest of the stream assuming a simple uniform distribution for these elements. Implemented on a Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU102 FPGA, the accelerator implements the method using only on-chip memory, with less than 50% resource usage. Tested on real network traces of up to 120 million packets and more than 5 million flows, the accelerator estimates the empirical entropy with less than 1.5% mean relative error and 21 μs latency, and supports a minimum throughput of 204 gigabits per second. © 2013 IEEE.;Data handling- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- HIgh speed networks- Data-plane processing- Fine-grained parallelism- Gigabits per second- Hardware accelerators- Mean relative error- Memory requirements- Network traffic monitoring- Uniform distribution- Entropy;English;Article

The SIS uses spatial gradients to compute a lightweight version of local binary patterns (LBP), which we term ringed LBP (RLBP). Our face recognition method, which is based on Ahonen’s algorithm, operates in three stages: (1) it extracts local image features using RLBP, (2) it computes a feature vector using RLBP histograms, (3) it projects the vector onto a subspace that maximizes class separation and classifies the image using a nearest neighbor criterion. We designed the smart pixel using the TSMC 0.35 µm mixed-signal CMOS process, and evaluated its performance using postlayout parasitic extraction. We also designed and implemented the digital coprocessor on a Xilinx XC7Z020 field-programmable gate array. The smart pixel achieves a fill factor of 34% on the 0.35 µm process and 76% on a 0.18 µm process with 32 µm × 32 µm pixels. The pixel array operates at up to 556 frames per second. The digital coprocessor achieves 96.5% classification accuracy on a database of infrared face images, can classify a 150 × 80-pixel image in 94 µs, and consumes 71 mW of power. © 2021 by the authors.

When such 0-day vulnerabilities are exploited, large portions of the network may get compromised as a result. In this work, we propose a network node migration strategy to minimize the impact of 0-day attacks on network reliability. The migration method proposes replacing homogeneous node implementations with diverse alternatives to yield a heterogeneous network. The migration method allocates heterogeneous nodes within the network by minimizing the product between the average and the maximum number of network partitions, which may emerge after the simultaneous exploitation of 0-day risks on shared network resources. As we show, our migration strategy maximizes network connectivity in the event of a simultaneous 0-day attack. Our work's significant findings are the following: First, increasing the heterogeneity in node technologies reduces the attacker's ability to break down the entire network. Second, given a set of available network technologies that partially share risks, a network design implemented using several heterogeneous technologies sharing a small number of 0-day risks is more reliable than one with a small number of technologies whose 0-day risks are disjoint. Third, we observed that in a node-heterogeneous network topology, clustering nodes by technology improves network reliability. © 2013 IEEE.;Heterogeneous networks- Reliability- Heterogeneous network topology- Heterogeneous nodes- Heterogeneous technology- Migration strategy- Network connectivity- Network partitions- Network reliability- Network technologies- Recurrent neural networks;English;Article

In particular, empirical entropy can be effectively used to detect anomalies in network traffic. However, computing the empirical entropy of a large dataset is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of memory. This is particularly important in high-speed network traffic analysis, where computing the entropy of a data flow in real time requires using hardware accelerators with restricted on-chip memory and arithmetic resources. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the entropy using a streaming algorithm with sublinear space requirements. Our approach uses a sketch to estimate the frequency of the elements in the stream, and a priority queue to store the top-k most frequent elements. We show that our method can provide a good approximation of the entropy of the dataset, and present the design of a hardware accelerator that can compute the entropy of the stream with a throughput of one packet per clock cycle. Implemented on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale + MPSoC ZCU102 FPGA, our accelerator can operate at line rates above 181 Gbps, consuming 511 mW and using less than 24% of the resources available on the device. © 2020 IEEE.;Computer hardware description languages- Data flow analysis- HIgh speed networks- Large dataset- System-on-chip- Systems analysis- Entropy estimation- Hardware accelerators- High speed network traffic- Large amounts- On chip memory- Priority queues- Space requirements- Streaming algorithm- Entropy;English;Conference Paper

In particular, the Multiscale Retinex with Chromacity Preservation (MSRCP) algorithm improves on the original Retinex by processing the image at multiple scales and adding a color balance step in postprocessing. Despite their advantages, multiscale Retinex algorithms are computationally intensive, and real-Time video processing is not generally possible with general-purpose processor architectures. In this paper, we present a special-purpose hardware accelerator for the MSRCP algorithm. The accelerator introduces tradeoffs to the original formulation of MSRCP by reducing the magnitude of the scales and using a cumulative histogram in the colorbalance stage. Despite these modifications, we show that the accelerator produces images that are visually almost identical to a software implementation of the original MSRCP algorithm. We implement our design on a Xilinx XC7A200T-1SBG484C FPGA, which is capable of processing $1280\times 720$-pixel video at up to 94 frames per second, a speedup of 123x compared to a desktop computer running a software version of the algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.;Color vision- Computer hardware- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- General purpose computers- Image enhancement- Personal computers- Systems analysis- Video signal processing- Chromacity preservations- General purpose processors- Hardware architecture- Human color perception- Image processing algorithm- Real-time video processing- Software implementation- Special purpose hardware- Color image processing;English;Conference Paper

Despite the availability of multiple computational tools designed for this purpose, most discriminative k-mer discovery methods suffer from long execution times and high memory usage when processing large datasets. This paper presents a novel approach for discriminative k-mer discovery in DNA sequences, which leverages streaming and sketch algorithms to reduce space complexity and expose data parallelism, enabling the use of parallel platforms for accelerating the execution of computationally-intensive operations. To assess the performance of our method, we designed and implemented two versions of the algorithm that leverage parallelization at different levels: (i) a software version tailored for multithreading and vector instructions in commodity CPUs, and (ii) a custom architecture implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerator that exploits fine-grain parallelism and deep pipelining on reconfigurable logic. Experimental results show that, when mining discriminative k-mers from a set of well-known ChIP-seq sequences, our parallel software implementation executes at least 15% faster than exact-counting tools, and requires at least five times less memory when processing large datasets. More importantly, we designed a custom FPGA-based accelerator for our algorithm on a Xilinx KCU1500 board, which achieves speedups above 78x with the largest datasets, compared to our parallel software implementation. The accelerator uses less than 3% of the logic resources available on the on-board XCKU115 Kintex-7 Ultrascale FPGA, and between 12% and 70% of the memory resources, depending on the size of the dataset. © 2013 IEEE.;Bioinformatics- DNA- DNA sequences- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Large dataset- Program processors- Reconfigurable architectures- Space platforms- Computational tools- DNA sequence analysis- Fine grain parallelism- Hardware acceleration- Parallel platforms- Parallel software- Reconfigurable logic- Software versions- Reconfigurable hardware;English;Article

A., Concepción, 1234, Chile- Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, 4030000, Chile;We present an instrument based on commodity embedded hardware, that implements an automatic procedure for early skin-cancer screening using dynamic thermal imaging. The procedure leverages image segmentation in the visible range and real-time multimodal registration to compute the temperature recovery curve (TRC) of suspicious skin lesions using thermal infrared video. The instrument implements two algorithms that infer the malignancy of the lesion from the computed TRCs. The first algorithm assumes that the TRCs are deterministic and infers the malignancy from the distance between the TRC of the suspicious lesion and its surrounding skin, which is assumed to be healthy tissue. The second algorithm models the TRC of the lesion as a random process and uses detection theory to statistically infer its malignancy from the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of its covariance function. We built a prototype of the instrument using a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ board, which acquires a visible-range image of the lesion at the beginning of the procedure and performs image segmentation in 62ms. Operating on a 400 × 400-pixel region-of-interest within the infrared video, the board performs frame-by-frame multimodal image registration and generates the TRCs in real time at more than 37 frames per second, thus eliminating the need to store video data for off-line processing. The statistical detection algorithm, which yields the best results, runs in 1.07s at the end of the procedure, and achieves a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 95% on a dataset of 116 volunteer subjects. © 2013 IEEE.;Classification (of information)- Dermatology- Diseases- Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions- Embedded software- Infrared imaging- Random processes- Signal detection- Thermography (imaging)- Automatic procedures- Detection algorithm- Multimodal image registration- Multimodal registration- Skin cancers- Statistical detection algorithms- Temperature recovery- Thermal infrared videos- Image segmentation;English;Article

The sketch is stored in on-chip memory, and the architecture exploits the parallelism available in the data by simultaneously processing each row of the sketch. The hash functions map each element to a set of counters on the sketch, and the sketch increments the counters that hold the minimum value, which corresponds to the estimated frequency of the element.

Commercial cameras typically do not handle the high dynamic range of such scenes in a proper manner, resulting in broadcast streams with very little shadow detail. We propose a hardware architecture for real-time shadow removal in high-resolution video, which reduces the shadow effect and simultaneously improves shadow details. The algorithm operates only on the shadow portions of each video frame, thus improving the results and producing more realistic images than algorithms that operate on the entire frame, such as simplified Retinex and histogram shifting. The architecture receives an input in the RGB color space, transforms it into the YIQ space, and uses color information from both spaces to produce a mask of the shadow areas present in the image. The mask is then filtered using a connected components algorithm to eliminate false positives and negatives. The hardware uses pixel information at the edges of the mask to estimate the illumination ratio between light and shadow in the image, which is then used to correct the shadow area.

In line with CS theory, the classification problem is solved using a sparse representation framework, where test images are modeled by means of a linear combination of the training set. Because the training set constitutes an over-complete dictionary, we identify new images by finding their sparsest representation based on the training set, using standard l1-minimization algorithms. Unlike conventional face-recognition algorithms, we feature extraction is performed using random projections with a precomputed binary matrix, as proposed in the CS literature. This random sampling reduces the effects of noise and occlusions such as facial hair, eyeglasses, and disguises, which are notoriously challenging in IR images. Thus, the performance of our framework is robust to these noise and occlusion factors, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 90% when the UCHThermalFace database is used for training and testing purposes. We implemented our framework on a high-performance embedded digital system, where the computation of the sparse representation of IR images was performed by a dedicated hardware using a deeply pipelined architecture on an Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). © 2017 SPIE.;Classification (of information)- Compressed sensing- Computation theory- Face recognition- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Infrared imaging- Compressive sensing- Embedded digital systems- Face recognition algorithms- Linear combinations- Over-complete dictionaries- Pipelined architecture- Sparse representation- Training and testing- Image processing;English;Conference Paper

While long association and projection bundles are stable and have been deeply studied, short association bundles present higher intersubject variability, and few studies have been carried out to adequately describe the structure, shape, and reproducibility of these bundles. However, their analysis is crucial to understand brain function and better characterize the human connectome. In this study, we propose an automatic method to identify reproducible short association bundles of the superficial white matter, based on intersubject hierarchical clustering. The method is applied to the whole brain and finds representative clusters of similar fibers belonging to a group of subjects, according to a distance metric between fibers. We experimented with both affine and non-linear registrations and, due to better reproducibility, chose the results obtained from non-linear registration. Once the clusters are calculated, our method performs automatic labeling of the most stable connections based on individual cortical parcellations. We compare results between two independent groups of subjects from a HARDI database to generate reproducible connections for the creation of an atlas. To perform a better validation of the results, we used a bagging strategy that uses pairs of groups of 27 subjects from a database of 74 subjects. The result is an atlas with 44 bundles in the left hemisphere and 49 in the right hemisphere, of which 33 bundles are found in both hemispheres. Finally, we use the atlas to automatically segment 78 new subjects from a different HARDI database and to analyze stability and lateralization results. © 2017 Román, Guevara, Valenzuela, Figueroa, Houenou, Duclap, Poupon, Mangin and Guevara.;adult- algorithm- Article- brain function- computer model- connectome- corpus callosum- correspondence analysis- data base- female- first cervical vertebra- fractional anisotropy- HARDI database- human- image segmentation- information processing- left hemisphere- male- neuroimaging- normal human- phylogenetic tree- reproducibility- right hemisphere- tractography- white matter- young adult;English;Article

The parameters of this transformation are estimated recursively on line with the video, thus enabling image registration in real time. The algorithm is implemented using a combination of embedded software and dedicated hardware units on a heterogeneous reconfigurable system-on-a-chip. The hardware performs feature detection and extraction, while the software estimates the transformation parameters and maps each visible video frame onto the infrared image coordinates. Implemented on an FPGA, our prototype runs at 540 frames per second with a 135 MHz clock, consumes 1.8 W and utilizes 29% and 54% of the logic and multiplier resources of the chip, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;Computer hardware- Dermatology- Diseases- Embedded systems- Extraction- Feature extraction- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Hardware- Image registration- Infrared devices- Infrared imaging- Infrared radiation- Parameter estimation- Program processors- System-on-chip- Video signal processing- Embedded system architectures- Infrared image sequence- Long wave infrared- Multimodal registration- Projective transformation- Spatio temporal features- Transformation parameters- Video processing- Image processing;English;Article

We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas, and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time, the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages, while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric, thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result, a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover, parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds, respectively. This performance enables the use of the algorithm in truly interactive applications for visualization, analysis, and segmentation of large white matter tractography datasets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;adult- algorithm- automated pattern recognition- brain- connectome- cytology- diffusion weighted imaging- female- human- image processing- male- nerve tract- procedures- software- white matter- young adult- Adult- Algorithms- Brain- Connectome- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Male- Neural Pathways- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Software- White Matter- Young Adult;English;Article

It consists of combining multiple signals over the same data channel and it has been very successful in classical communications. However, the use of enhanced channels has only reached limited practicality in quantum communications (QC) as it requires the manipulation of quantum systems of higher dimensions. Considerable effort is being made towards QC using high-dimensional quantum systems encoded into the transverse momentum of single photons, but so far no approach has been proven to be fully compatible with the existing telecommunication fibers. Here we overcome such a challenge and demonstrate a secure high-dimensional decoy-state quantum key distribution session over a 300-m-long multicore optical fiber. The high-dimensional quantum states are defined in terms of the transverse core modes available for the photon transmission over the fiber, and theoretical analyses show that positive secret key rates can be achieved through metropolitan distances. © 2017 American Physical Society.;Fibers- Optical fibers- Photons- Quantum optics- Quantum theory- Classical communication- Fully compatible- Higher dimensions- Multi-core optical fibers- Photon transmission- Telecommunication fibers- Transmission capacities- Transverse momenta- Quantum cryptography;English;Article

However, most of the existing research in RTE technologies has traditionally focused on formal models and theoretical analyzes of timing properties, usually omitting the associated implementation challenges for testing them in practice. This gap between theory and practice prevents experimental validation of the claimed properties, which in turn hinders the pace of innovation and adoption of the technology in industrial settings. This paper aims at narrowing the theory-practice gap by characterizing a comprehensive open-source RTE framework that explores emerging challenges in real-time networking, including the provision of ultra-low latency and jitter, dynamic bandwidth management, and segmentation within large networks. This work integrates research on formal abstractions for dynamic time-division multiple access arbitration and technological insights from modern hardware infrastructure, and uses a representative distributed video processing application to provide reproducible evidence of the achieved properties in multihop Ethernet settings. By leveraging readily available technology and an open-source design, the proposed framework facilitates further exploration and experimental validation of properties that are beyond the scope of current commercial technologies, encouraging evidence-based discussions to accelerate development and adoption of new standards for next-generation industrial networks. © 2016 IEEE.;Ethernet- Real time systems- Video signal processing- Dynamic time- Industrial networking- Open source platforms- Real time Ethernet- State based- Time division multiple access;English;Article

Esteban S. Iturra s/n, Concepción, 4030000, Chile;Images rendered by uncooled microbolometer-based infrared (IR) cameras are severely degraded by the spatial non-uniformity (NU) noise. The NU noise imposes a fixed-pattern over the true images, and the intensity of the pattern changes with time due to the temperature instability of such cameras. In this paper, we present a novel model and a compensation algorithm for the spatial NU noise and its temperature-dependent variations. The model separates the NU noise into two components: a constant term, which corresponds to a set of NU parameters determining the spatial structure of the noise, and a dynamic term, which scales linearly with the fluctuations of the temperature surrounding the array of microbolometers. We use a black-body radiator and samples of the temperature surrounding the IR array to offline characterize both the constant and the temperature-dependent NU noise parameters. Next, the temperature-dependent variations are estimated online using both a spatially uniform Hammerstein-Wiener estimator and a pixelwise least mean squares (LMS) estimator. We compensate for the NU noise in IR images from two long-wave IR cameras. Results show an excellent NU correction performance and a root mean square error of less than 0.25 °C, when the array’s temperature varies by approximately 15 °C. © 2016 by the authors- licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;Bolometers- Cameras- Image enhancement- Image reconstruction- Imaging techniques- Infrared imaging- Temperature sensors- Thermography (imaging)- Correction performance- Image reconstruction techniques- Least mean square (LMS)- Noise in imaging systems- Physical sensors- Root mean square errors- Temperature instability- Uncooled microbolometers- Mean square error;English;Article

The algorithm classifies each pixel in an image into one of three classes: bruised, non-bruised, and background. We extract two 5-element feature vectors for each pixel using only 10 out of the 236 spectral bands provided by the hyperspectral camera, thereby greatly reducing both the requirements of the imager and the computational complexity of the algorithm. We then use two linear-kernel support vector machine (SVM) to classify each pixel. Each SVM was trained with 504 windows of size 17×17-pixel taken from 14 hyperspectral images of 320×320 pixels each, for each class. The architecture then computes the percentage of bruised pixels in each apple in order to adequately classify the fruit. We implemented the architecture on a Xilinx Zynq Z-7010 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and tested it on images from a NIR N17E push-broom camera with a frame rate of 25 fps, a band-pixel rate of 1.888 MHz, and 236 spectral bands between 900 and 1700 nanometers in laboratory conditions. Using 28-bit fixed-point arithmetic, the circuit accurately discriminates 95.2% of the pixels corresponding to an apple, 81% of the pixels corresponding to a bruised apple, and 96.4% of the background. With the default threshold settings, the highest false positive (FP) for a bruised apple is 18.7%.

The circuit is fast, compact, low power, and is capable of eliminating the striping noise in-line during the image acquisition process. The architecture implements a multi dimensional neural network (MDNN) algorithm for striping noise compensation previously reported by our group. The algorithm relies on the assumption that the amount of light impinging at the neighboring photo-detectors is approximately the same in the spatial and spectral dimensions. Under this assumption, two striping noise parameters are estimated using spatial and spectral information from the raw data. We implemented the circuit on a Xilinx ZYNQ XC7Z2010 FPGA and tested it with images obtained from a NIR N17E push-broom camera, with a frame rate of 25fps and a band-pixel rate of 1.888 MHz.

Here we present a third solution that might exceed the performance and practicality of the previous two in circumventing detector side-channel attacks, which arguably is the most hazardous part of QKD implementations. Our proposal has, however, one main requirement: the legitimate users of the system need to ensure that their labs do not leak any unwanted information to the outside.

We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained with 306 images of 51 different subjects, to recognize human face textures. Finally, we group the classified pixels into rectangular boxes enclosing the faces using an algorithm for connected components. These boxes can then be used to track, count, or identify faces in a scene, for example. We implemented our architecture on a Xilinx XC6SLX45 FPGA and tested it on 306 IR images of 51 subjects, different from the data used to train the SVM.

The circuit is fast, compact and low power, can recognize faces in real time and be embedded in a larger image-processing and computer vision system operating locally on an IR camera. The algorithm uses Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to perform feature extraction on each IR image. First, each pixel in the image is represented as an LBP pattern that encodes the similarity between the pixel and its neighbors. Uniform LBP codes are then used to reduce the number of patterns to 59 while preserving more than 90% of the information contained in the original LBP representation. Then, the image is divided into 64 non-overlapping regions, and each region is represented as a 59-bin histogram of patterns. Finally, the algorithm concatenates all 64 regions to create a 3,776-bin spatially enhanced histogram. We reduce the dimensionality of this histogram using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), which improves clustering and enables us to store an entire database of 53 subjects on-chip. During classification, the circuit applies LBP and LDA to each incoming IR image in real time, and compares the resulting feature vector to each pattern stored in the local database using the Manhattan distance. We implemented the circuit on a Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A100T FPGA and tested it with the UCHThermalFace database, which consists of 28 81 × 150-pixel images of 53 subjects in indoor and outdoor conditions.

The model was conceived after analyzing, in the spatial frequency domain, FPN calibration data from different IR cameras and technologies. The analysis showed that the spatial patterns of the FPN are retained in the phase spectrum, while the noise intensity is determined by the magnitude spectrum. Thus, unlike traditional representations, the proposed model abstracts the FPN structure using one matrix for its magnitude spectrum and another matrix for its phase spectrum. Three applications of the model are addressed here. First, an algorithm is provided for generating random samples of the FPN with the same spatial pattern of the actual FPN. Second, the model is used to assess the performance of non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithms in the presence of spatially correlated and uncorrelated FPN. Third, the model is used to improve the NUC capability of a method that requires, as a reference, a proper FPN sample. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We describe a sequential version of the algorithm that runs on a desktop computer CPU, as well as a highly parallel version that uses a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) as an accelerator. Our sequential implementation runs 270 times faster than a C++/Python implementation of a previous algorithm based on the same segmentation method, and 21 times faster than a highly optimized C version of the same previous algorithm. Our parallelized implementation exploits the multiple computation units and memory hierarchy of the GPU to further speed up the algorithm by a factor of 30 with respect to our sequential code.

Analog Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is an attractive technology to achieve compact and low-power implementations of these computationally intensive tasks for portable embedded devices. However, device mismatch limits the resolution of the circuits fabricated with this technology. Traditional layout techniques to reduce the mismatch aim to increase the resolution at the transistor level, without considering the intended application. Relating mismatch parameters to specific effects in the application level would allow designers to apply focalized mismatch compensation techniques according to predefined performance/cost tradeoffs. This paper models, analyzes, and evaluates the effects of mismatched analog arithmetic in both feature extraction and classification circuits. For the feature extraction, we propose analog adaptive linear combiners with on-chip learning for both Least Mean Square (LMS) and Generalized Hebbian Algorithm (GHA). Using mathematical abstractions of analog circuits, we identify mismatch parameters that are naturally compensated during the learning process, and propose cost-effective guidelines to reduce the effect of the rest. For the classification, we derive analog models for the circuits necessary to implement Nearest Neighbor (NN) approach and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, and use them to emulate analog classifiers with standard databases of face and hand-writing digits. Formal analysis and experiments show how we can exploit adaptive structures and properties of the input space to compensate the effects of device mismatch at the application level, thus reducing the design overhead of traditional layout techniques. Results are also directly extensible to multiple application domains using linear subspace methods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;Classification (of information)- Feature extraction- Image recognition- Learning algorithms- Networks (circuits)- Principal component analysis- Radial basis function networks- Analog very large scale integration- Analog VLSI- Feature extraction and classification- Generalized Hebbian algorithm- Least mean square algorithms- Linear discriminant analysis- Mathematical abstraction- On-chip learning- VLSI circuits- algorithm- arithmetic- article- calibration- classification- classifier- controlled study- discriminant analysis- distance computation- Generalized Hebbian Algorithm- image processing- image recognition- Least Mean Square algorithm- linear discriminant analysis- Loser Take All- mathematical model- mathematical phenomena- nearest neighbor- principal component analysis- priority journal- radial basis function network- simulation- Very Large Scale Integration- algorithm- artificial intelligence- artificial neural network- automated pattern recognition- biometry- cluster analysis- computer simulation- discriminant analysis- evaluation study- handwriting- human- procedures- regression analysis- statistical model- Algorithms- Artificial Intelligence- Biometric Identification- Cluster Analysis- Computer Simulation- Discriminant Analysis- Handwriting- Humans- Least-Squares Analysis- Linear Models- Neural Networks (Computer)- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Principal Component Analysis;English;Article

All these tasks are implemented as independent modules to give the system the capability to reconfigure the hardware for any other application with similar requirements. Results show that FPGAs are a suitable platform to implement a power converter digital controller.

However, standard Ethernet components require specific modifications and hardware support to provide strict latency guarantees necessary for safety-critical applications. Although this is a well-stated fact, the design of hardware components for real-time communication remains mostly unexplored. This becomes evident from the few solutions reporting prototypes and experimental validation, which hinders the consolidation of Ethernet in real-world distributed applications. This paper presents Atacama, the first open-source framework based on reconfigurable hardware for mixed-criticality communication in multi-segmented Ethernet networks. Atacama uses specialized modules for time-triggered communication of real-time data, which seamlessly integrate with a standard infrastructure using regular best-effort traffic. Atacama enables low and highly predictable communication latency on multi-segmented 1Gbps networks, easy optimization of devices for specific application scenarios, and rapid prototyping of new protocol characteristics. Researchers can use the open-source design to verify our results and build upon the framework, which aims to accelerate the development, validation, and adoption of Ethernet-based solutions in real-time applications. © 2013 IEEE.;Distributed applications- Distributed real time system- Experimental validations- Open-source hardwares- Real time Ethernet- Safety critical applications- Safety critical systems- Time-triggered communications- Communication- Computers- Criticality (nuclear fission)- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Hardware- Rapid prototyping- Real time systems- Systems analysis- Ethernet;English;Conference Paper

This paper presents a systematic comparison between these two technologies, depicting the main advantages and drawbacks of each one. Key programming and implementation aspects are addressed in order to give an overall idea of their most important features and allow the comparison between DSP and FPGA devices. A classical linear control strategy for a well-known voltage-source-converter (VSC)-based topology used as Static Compensator (STATCOM) is considered as a driving example to evaluate the performance of both approaches. A proof-of-concept laboratory prototype is separately controlled with the TMS320F2812 DSP and the Spartan-3 XCS1000 FPGA to illustrate the characteristics of both technologies. In the case of the DSP, a virtual floating-point library is used to accelerate the control routines compared to double precision arithmetic. On the other hand, two approaches are developed for the FPGA implementation, the first one reduces the hardware utilization and the second one reduces the computation time. Even though both boards can successfully control the STATCOM, results show that the FPGA achieves the best computation time thanks to the high degree of parallelism available on the device. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;Degree of parallelism- Digital control- Digital signal processors (DSP)- Hardware utilization- Implementation aspects- Performance comparison- Static compensator- Voltage source converters- Digital arithmetic- Digital control systems- Digital libraries- Digital signal processors- Electric current regulators- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Linear control systems- Synchronous machinery- Digital signal processing;English;Article

Fermi 6 I-50125, Firenze, Italy;Any practical realization of entanglement-based quantum communication must be intrinsically secure and able to span long distances avoiding the need of a straight line between the communicating parties. The violation of Bell's inequality offers a method for the certification of quantum links without knowing the inner workings of the devices. Energy-time entanglement quantum communication satisfies all these requirements. However, currently there is a fundamental obstacle with the standard configuration adopted: an intrinsic geometrical loophole that can be exploited to break the security of the communication, in addition to other loopholes. Here we show the first experimental Bell violation with energy-time entanglement distributed over 1 km of optical fibres that is free of this geometrical loophole. This is achieved by adopting a new experimental design, and by using an actively stabilized fibre-based long interferometer. Our results represent an important step towards long-distance secure quantum communication in optical fibres. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The model for the NU noise considers pixelwise gain and o set parameters. The representation for the self-heating dynamics of the camera is an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model for camera's internal temperature. The algorithm performs initially a two-point calibration at a known surrounding temperature. Next, without modifying the NU parameters, we dynamically compensate variations in the camera readout using both estimates of the ARMA model and measurements of the surrounding temperature taken by a simple sensor embedded in the camera. Tested on a CEDIP Jade UC33 camera, our system compensates reference black-body images at 30 degrees Celsius, with a peak error below 1.3 and a mean error below 0.3 degrees Celsius, in scenarios where the room temperature varied up to 14 degrees Celsius. Moreover, the regularity and simplicity of the algorithm enables us to implement it on embedded digital hardware, thereby reducing its cost, size, and power consumption. We implemented the algorithm on a Xilinx XC6SLX45 FPGA using xed-point arithmetic. The circuit exhibits an arithmetic error of 0.06 degrees compared to a software double-precision implementation. It compensates 320 x 240-pixel video at up to 1,437 fps and 640 x 480-pixel video at up to 360 fps, using 1% of the logic resources of the FPGA, and less than 1 mW of dynamic power at 110 MHz.

The first metric, which has been defined in the spatial domain, quantifies the spatial similarity between an estimate and a sample of the NU noise using the cosine distance. The second metric characterizes the spectrum of the NU noise, and uses this characterization to quantify the fraction of NU noise that has been properly estimated. To test the effectiveness and consistency of the proposed metrics in assessing the NU noise, five previously reported NU correction algorithms have been ranked. To evaluate metrics's simplicity, the most computing intensive and resource demanding metric has been implemented on an inexpensive FPGA with low resource utilization. © 2013 IEEE.;Correction algorithms- Fixed pattern noise- Nonuniformity- Resource utilizations- Spatial and frequency domain- Spatial domains- Spatial similarity- Spatial structure- Infrared imaging- Optoelectronic devices;English;Conference Paper

Implementing the algorithm in hardware results in a fast, compact, low-power nonuniformity correction (NUC) system that can be embedded into an intelligent imager at a very low cost. Because it does not use an external reference, our NUC circuit works in real time during normal operation, and can track parameter drift over time. Our NUC system models NU noise as a spatially regular source of additive noise, uses a Kalman filter to estimate the offset in each detector of the array and applies an inverse model to recover the original information captured by the detector. The NUC board uses a low-cost Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S500E FPGA operating at 75MHz. The NUC circuit consumes 17.3mW of dynamic power and uses only 10% of the logic resources of the FPGA. Despite ignoring the multiplicative effects of nonuniformity, our NUC circuit reaches a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 35dB in under 50 frames, referenced to two-point calibration using black bodies. This performance lies within 0.35dB of a double-precision Matlab implementation of the algorithm. Without the bandwidth limitations currently imposed by the external RAM that stores the offset estimations, our circuit can correct 320×240-pixel video at up to 1,254 frames per second. © 2012 SPIE.;Algorithms- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Hardware- Infrared devices- Kalman filters- Signal processing- VLSI circuits- Bandwidth limitation- Embedded signal processing- Infrared focal plane arrays- Multiplicative effects- Nonuniformity correction- Peak signal-to-noise ratio- Two-point calibration- VLSI- Estimation;English;Conference Paper

However, intrinsic limitations of analog hardware, such as device mismatch, charge leakage, and noise, reduce the accuracy of analog arithmetic circuits, degrading the performance of large-scale adaptive systems. In this paper, we present a detailed mathematical analysis that relates different parameters of the hardware limitations to specific effects on the convergence properties of linear perceptrons trained with the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. Using this analysis, we derive design guidelines and introduce simple on-chip calibration techniques to improve the accuracy of analog neural networks with a small cost in die area and power dissipation. We validate our analysis by evaluating the performance of a mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor implementation of a 32-input perceptron trained with LMS. © 2011 IEEE.;Analog hardware- Analog neural network- Analog very large scale integration- Analog VLSI- Arithmetic circuit- Calibration techniques- Charge leakage- Complementary metal oxide semiconductors- Convergence properties- Design guidelines- Device mismatch- Die area- Digital counterparts- Least mean square algorithms- Linear perceptrons- LMS algorithms- Mathematical analysis- Mixed signal- On chips- On-chip learning- Perceptron- Specific effects- Adaptive systems- Algorithms- Convergence of numerical methods- Neural networks- Pattern recognition systems- Analog circuits- algorithm- analog computer- article- artificial intelligence- artificial neural network- Algorithms- Artificial Intelligence- Computers, Analog- Neural Networks (Computer);English;Article

These ana log circuits exhibit nonlinear transfer function characteris tics and suffer from device mismatches, degrading network performance. Because of the high cost involved with analog VLSI production, it is beneficial to predict implementation performance during design. We present an FPGA-based accelerator for the emulation of large (500+ synapses, 10k+ test samples) single-neuron ANNs implemented in analog VLSI. We used hardware time-multiplexing to scale network size and maximize hardware usage. An on-chip CPU controls the data flow through various memory systems to allow for large test sequences. We show that Block-RAM availability is the main implemen tation bottleneck and that a trade-off arises between emulation speed and hardware resources. However, we can emulate large amounts of synapses on an FPGA with limited resources. We have obtained a speedup of 30.5 times with respect to an optimized software implementation on a desktop computer. © 2010 IEEE.;Analog VLSI- Artificial Neural Network- Artificial neural networks- Data flow- Desktop computer- Device mismatch- FPGA-based accelerators- Hardware resources- High costs- Memory systems- Network size- Nonlinear transfer functions- On chips- Single-neuron- Software implementation- Test samples- Test sequence- Time multiplexing- Analog circuits- Computer hardware- Design- Hardware- Linear accelerators- Multiplexing- Network architecture- Network performance- Networks (circuits)- Random access storage- Systems analysis- VLSI circuits- Neural networks;English;Conference Paper

Moreover, they do it at much lower costs and shorter times to market than non-reconfigurable hardware solutions. They also provide the flexibility that is often required for the engineering of modern robust and adaptive systems. Due to their heterogeneity, flexibility and potential for highly optimized application-specific instantiation, reconfigurable systems are adequate for a very broad class of applications across different industry sectors. What prevents the reconfigurable system paradigm from a broad proliferation is the lack of adequate development methodologies and electronics design tools for this kind of systems. The ideal would be a seamless compilation of a high-level computation process specification into an optimized mixture of machine code executed on traditional CPU-centric processors and on the application-specific decentralized parallel data-flow-dominated reconfigurable processors and hardware accelerators. Although much research and development in this direction was recently performed, the adequate methodologies and tools necessary to implement this compilation process as an effective and efficient hardware/software co-synthesis flow are unfortunately not yet in place. This paper focuses on the recent developments and development trends in the design methods and synthesis tools for reconfigurable systems. Reconfigurable system synthesis performs two basic tasks: system structure construction and application process mapping on the structure. It is thus more complex than standard (multi-)processor-based system synthesis for software-programmable systems that only involves application mapping. The system structure construction may involve the macro-architecture synthesis, the micro-architecture synthesis, and the actual hardware synthesis. Also, the application process mapping can be more complicated and dynamic in reconfigurable systems. This paper reviews the recent methods and tools for the macro- and micro-architecture synthesis, and for the application mapping of reconfigurable systems. It puts much attention to the relevant and currently hot topic of (re-)configurable application-specific instruction set processors (ASIP) synthesis, and specifically, ASIP instruction set extension. It also discusses the methods and tools for reconfigurable systems involving CPU-centric processors collaborating with reconfigurable hardware sub-systems, for which the main problem is to decide which computation processes should be implemented in software and which in hardware, but the hardware/software partitioning has to account for the hardware sharing by different computation processes and for the reconfiguration processes. The reconfigurable system area is a very promising, but quite a new field, with many open research and development topics. The paper reviews some of the future trends in the reconfigurable system development methods and tools. Finally, the discussion of the paper is summarized and concluded. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although the use of pictograms in the context of medical instructions has been widely studied, in our country, there are no studies about their usefulness, or which set of symbols should be used by the systems. This work aims to present the first step towards the development of platforms that automatically suggest pictograms to supplement medical instructions for primary care settings in Chile. Materials and methods: In this pilot study, we collected and analyzed the physicians' opinions on the selection of medical instructions that later will automatically be supplemented by the software that is under construction. We designed an expert validation survey using a set of 66 medical instructions with pictograms. This survey provided three rating options for each medical instruction: Not necessary (supplementing the instruction with a pictogram does not carry any value), Useful (supplementing the instruction with a pictogram may help patients to understand and remember the instruction), and Essential (supplementing the instruction with a pictogram is essential). Seventy-one physicians responded to the survey. Results: 22 out of 66 medical instructions were considered “essential” by >=51% of the experts, and 12 of the 66 were considered to be “useful but not essential” by >=51% of the experts. Conclusion: Results of our survey validate the potential use of pictograms as a complement to better comprehension of medical instructions in our country. © 2022 AGBM;adult- article- Chile- comprehension- female- human- male- medical education- physician- pilot study- primary medical care- software;English;Article

We designed this algorithm to function as a decision aid for healthcare professionals. Multiple chronic conditions are an important factor influencing mortality in older adults. At the same time, cardiovascular events in older adult patients are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This study aimed to design a machine learning model capable of predicting mortality risk in older adult patients with cardiovascular pathologies and multiple chronic diseases using the Cardiovascular Health Study database. The methodology for algorithm design included (i) database analysis, (ii) variable selection, (iii) feature matrix creation and data preprocessing, (iv) model training, and (v) performance analysis. The analysis and variable selection were performed through previous knowledge, correlation, and histograms to visualize the data distribution. The machine learning models selected were random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. The models were trained using two sets of variables. First, eight years of the data were summarized as the mode of all years per patient for each variable (123 variables). The second set of variables was obtained from the mode every three years (369 variables). The results show that the random forest trained with the second set of variables has the best performance (89% accuracy), which is better than other reported results in the literature. © 2022 by the authors.;-;English;Article

The active learning (AL) approach to classification heavily lessens such cost by reducing the number of labeled documents required to achieve specified performance. This article introduces a query strategy and a stopping criterion that transform CREGEX, a regular-expressions-based text classification algorithm, in an AL biomedical text classifier. The query strategy samples the training dataset, trading off the greedy learning achieved by the regular expressions classification precision and the conservative learning induced by text sequence alignment classification. The sustained reduction in the variance of the query strategy scores is used as a stopping criterion. The AL classifier was compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and a classifier based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), using three datasets with biomedical information in Spanish on smoking habits, obesity, and obesity types. The learning curve results indicate that AL in CREGEX allowed to efficiently reduce the number of training examples for equal performance than the rest of the classifiers, obtaining areas under the learning curve greater than 85% in all cases. The stopping criterion applied to the AL process allowed to use, on average, approximately 32% to 50% of the total training examples with differences in performance concerning the maximum value of the learning curve not exceeding 2%. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of using AL in a biomedical text classifier based on regular expressions, which is attributable to such expressions' ability to represent intricate sequential patterns in training texts considered most informative. © 2013 IEEE.;Bioinformatics- Decision making- Information retrieval systems- Nutrition- Pattern matching- Support vector machines- Text processing- Automatically generated- Biomedical information- Clinical decision making- Conservative learning- Regular expressions- Sequence alignments- Sequential patterns- Text classification- Classification (of information);English;Article

This work presents an innovative method for a recommendation system for the diagnosis of breast cancer using patient medical histories. In this proposal, techniques of natural language processing (NLP) were implemented on real datasets: one comprised 160, 560 medical histories of anonymous patients from a hospital in Chile for the following categories: breast cancer, cysts and nodules, other cancer, breast cancer surgeries and other diagnoses- and the other dataset was obtained from the MIMIC III dataset. With the application of word-embedding techniques, such as word2vec's skip-gram and BERT, and machine learning techniques, a recommendation system as a tool to support the physician's decision-making was implemented. The obtained results demonstrate that using word embeddings can define a good-quality recommendation system. The results of 20 experiments with 5-fold cross-validation for anamnesis written in Spanish yielded an F1 of 0.980 ± 0.0014 on the classification of 'cancer' versus 'not cancer' and 0.986 ± 0.0014 for 'breast cancer' versus 'other cancer'.

In medical informatics, regular expression-based classifiers have emerged as an alternative to traditional, discriminative classification algorithms due to their ability to model sequential patterns. This article presents CREGEX (Classifier Regular Expression), a biomedical text classifier based on an automatically generated regular-expressions-based feature space. We conceived an algorithm for automatically constructing an informative and discriminative regular-expressions-based feature space, suitable for binary and multiclass discrimination problems. Regular expressions are automatically generated from training texts using a coarse-to-fine text aligning method, which trades off the lexical variants of words, in terms of gender and grammatical number, and the generation of a feature space containing a large number of noisy features. CREGEX carries out feature selection by filtering keywords and also computes a confidence metric to classify test texts. Three de-identified datasets in Spanish, with information on smoking habits, obesity, and obesity types, were used here to assess the performance of CREGEX. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB) supervised classifiers were also trained with consecutive sequences of tokens (n-grams) as features. Results show that, in all the datasets used for evaluation, CREGEX not only outperformed both the SVM and NB classifiers in terms of accuracy and F-measure (p-value<0.05) but also used a fewer amount of training examples to achieve the same performance. Such a superior performance is attributed to the regular expressions' ability to represent complex text patterns. © 2013 IEEE.;Barium compounds- Decision making- Medical informatics- Nutrition- Pattern matching- Sodium compounds- Support vector machines- Text processing- Automatically generated- Biomedical informatics- Classification algorithm- Clinical decision making- Regular expressions- Sequence alignments- Supervised classifiers- Text classification- Classification (of information);English;Article

Using Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment algorithms, tokens were extracted from biomedical texts and represented by common patterns. Three manually annotated datasets with information on obesity, obesity types, and smoking habits were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Features extracted using consecutive sequences of tokens (n-grams) were used for comparison, and both types of features were mathematically represented using the TF-IDF vector model.

The Chilean government established an inter-agency program to define the current interoperabiity situation, existing gaps, barriers, and facilitators for interoperable health information systems. As an answer to the identified issues, the government decided to fund a consortium of Chilean universities to create the National Center for Health Information Systems.

In this work, we present a method of identifying obesity automatically using text mining techniques and information related to body weight measures and obesity comorbidities. We used a dataset of 3015 de-identified medical records that contain labels for two classification problems. The first classification problem distinguishes between obesity, overweight, normal weight, and underweight. The second classification problem differentiates between obesity types: super obesity, morbid obesity, severe obesity and moderate obesity. We used a Bag of Words approach to represent the records together with unigram and bigram representations of the features. We implemented two approaches: a hierarchical method and a nonhierarchical one. We used Support Vector Machine and Naïve Bayes together with ten-fold cross validation to evaluate and compare performances. Our results indicate that the hierarchical approach does not work as well as the nonhierarchical one. In general, our results show that Support Vector Machine obtains better performances than Naïve Bayes for both classification problems.

The clinical narrative text was processed using natural language processing techniques, and annotated by four people with a biomedical background. The dataset used for classification had 2,465 documents, each one annotated with one of the four smoking status categories. We used two feature representations: single word token and bigrams. The classification problem was divided in two levels. First recognizing between smoker (S) and non-smoker (NS)- second recognizing between current smoker (CS) and past smoker (PS). For each feature representation and classification level, we used two classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Bayesian Networks (BN). We split our dataset as follows: a training set containing 66% of the available documents that was used to build classifiers and a test set containing the remaining 34% of the documents that was used to test and evaluate the model. Our results show that SVM together with the bigram representation performed better in both classification levels. For S vs NS classification level performance measures were: ACC=85%, Precision=85%, and Recall=90%. For CS vs PS classification level performance measures were: ACC=87%, Precision=91%, and Recall=94%. © 2014 IEEE.;Bayesian networks- Information retrieval systems- Natural language processing systems- Statistical tests- Support vector machines- Bigrams- Feature representation- Natural languages- Performance measure- Single words- Status informations- Test sets- Training sets- Classification (of information)- Bayes theorem- Chile- classification- electronic medical record- factual database- human- natural language processing- smoking- support vector machine- verbal communication- Bayes Theorem- Chile- Databases, Factual- Electronic Health Records- Humans- Narration- Natural Language Processing- Smoking- Support Vector Machines;English;Conference Paper

Still, there is no assurance that only one source obtained from this method will contain AA, and thus we aim to select the most representative source of AA. The novelty in this paper is the proposal of three parameters to select the most representative source of AA. These parameters are correlation coefficient with lead V1 (CV1), peak factor (PF) and spectral concentration (SC). The first two parameters are introduced as new indicators, addressing features overlooked by the SC even when they are present in AA during AF. For synthesized data, at least two of the three parameters select the same representation of AA in 93.3% of the cases. For real data (218 ECG recordings), we observe that PF presents, in 89.5% of the cases, values between 2 and 4.5 for the selected sources, ensuring a well-defined range of values for AA. The actual values of CV1 and SC were scattered throughout their possible ranges (0-1 for CV1 and 0.08-0.7 for SC), and the correlation coefficient between these variables was found to be ρ = 0.58. We compared our results with three known algorithms: QRST cancellation, principal components analysis (PCA) and ICA-SOBI. The results obtained from this comparison show that our proposed methods to select the best representation of AA in general outperform the three above-mentioned algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Correlation coefficient- Independent component analysis(ICA)- Kurtosis- Principal components analysis- Second order blind identifications- Selection parameters- Algorithms- Blind source separation- Correlation methods- Diseases- Independent component analysis- Power spectral density- Principal component analysis- Electrocardiography- algorithm- article- electrocardiogram- heart atrium fibrillation- heart atrium function- human- independent component analysis- principal component analysis- priority journal- QRS complex- QT interval- recording- Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Blind source separation- Correlation- ECG- Kurtosis- Power spectral density- Selection parameters- Atrial Fibrillation- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Principal Component Analysis- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

In particular, the study of AF types or sub-classes is a very interesting research topic. In this paper we present a preliminary study to find sub-classes of AF from real 12-lead ECG recordings using k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms. We applied blind source separation to an initial set of 218 recordings from which we extracted a subset of 136 atrial activity signals displaying known properties of AF. As features for clustering we proposed the peak frequency mean value (PFM), peak frequency standard deviation (PFSD) and the spectral concentration (SC). We computed the silhouette coefficient to obtain an optimal number of clusters of k=5, and conducted preliminary feature selection to evaluate clustering quality. We observed that the separability increases if we discard SC as a feature. The proposed method is the first stage to a future AF classification method, which combined with specialist advice, should help in the clinical field. © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation- Classification methods- Clinical research- Clustering quality- Ecg measurements- Hierarchical clustering algorithms- Peak frequencies- Spectral concentrations- Blind source separation- Diseases- Electrocardiography- Frequency standards- Clustering algorithms- algorithm- atrial fibrillation- automated pattern recognition- cluster analysis- electrocardiography- heart atrium- human- normal distribution- pathophysiology- procedures- reproducibility- signal processing- Algorithms- Atrial Fibrillation- Cluster Analysis- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Normal Distribution- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Reproducibility of Results- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Conference Paper

The work is divided in two parts. The first part is an analysis of the medical equipment inventory for the institution of study. We consider the replacement, maintenance, and reinforcement of the available medical equipment by considering local guidelines and surveying clinical personnel appreciation. The resulting recommendation is to upgrade the current equipment inventory if necessary. The second part considered a demand analysis in the short and medium term. We predicted the future demand with a 5-year horizon using Holt-Winters models. Inventory analysis showed that 27% of the medical equipment in stock was not functional. Due to this poor performance result we suggested that the hospital gradually addresses this situation by replacing 29 non-functional equipment items, reinforcing stock with 40 new items, and adding 11 items not available in the inventory but suggested by the national guidelines. The results suggest that general medicine inpatient demand has a tendency to increase within the time e.g. for general medicine inpatient service the highest increment is obtained by respiratory (12%, RMSE=8%) and genitourinary diseases (20%, RMSE=9%). This increment did not involve any further upgrading of the proposed inventory. © 2013 IEEE.;Demand analysis- Equipment inventory- Holt-Winters- Inpatient services- Inventory analysis- Medium term- Non-functional- Poor performance- Hospitals- Reinforcement- Equipment- article- devices- diseases- hospital discharge- hospital patient- human- information processing- public hospital- statistics- Data Collection- Disease- Equipment and Supplies- Hospitals, Public- Humans- Inpatients- Patient Discharge;English;Conference Paper

However, a question remains: How much data must be annotated to create a suitable training set for a machine learning classifier? In prior research with active learning in medical text classification, we found evidence that not only sample size but also some of the intrinsic characteristics of the texts being analyzed - such as the size of the vocabulary and the length of a document - may also influence the resulting classifier's performance. This study is an attempt to create a regression model to predict performance based on sample size and other text features. While the model needs to be trained on existing datasets, we believe it is feasible to predict performance without obtaining annotations from new datasets once the model is built. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.;Artificial intelligence- Bioinformatics- Classification (of information)- Data mining- Information retrieval systems- Learning algorithms- Regression analysis- Supervised learning- Classifier's performance- Intrinsic characteristics- performance- Performance based- regression- Sample sizes- Supervised machine learning- Text classification- Text processing- artificial intelligence- automated pattern recognition- classification- controlled vocabulary- data mining- documentation- information processing- meaningful use criteria- natural language processing- nomenclature- procedures- sample size- statistics and numerical data- Artificial Intelligence- Data Curation- Data Mining- Documentation- Meaningful Use- Natural Language Processing- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Sample Size- Terminology as Topic- Vocabulary, Controlled;English;Conference Paper

Design Three existing active learning algorithms (distance-based (DIST), diversity-based (DIV), and a combination of both (CMB)) were used to classify text from five datasets. The performance of these algorithms was compared to that of passive learning on the five datasets. We then conducted a novel investigation of the interaction between dataset characteristics and the performance results. Measurements Classification accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for each algorithm at different sample sizes were generated. The performance of active learning algorithms was compared with that of passive learning using a weighted mean of paired differences. To determine why the performance varies on different datasets, we measured the diversity and uncertainty of each dataset using relative entropy and correlated the results with the performance differences. Results The DIST and CMB algorithms performed better than passive learning. With a statistical significance level set at 0.05, DIST outperformed passive learning in all five datasets, while CMB was found to be better than passive learning in four datasets. We found strong correlations between the dataset diversity and the DIV performance, as well as the dataset uncertainty and the performance of the DIST algorithm. Conclusion For medical text classification, appropriate active learning algorithms can yield performance comparable to that of passive learning with considerably smaller training sets. In particular, our results suggest that DIV performs better on data with higher diversity and DIST on data with lower uncertainty.;accuracy- active learning- area under the curve- article- biomedicine- clinical classification- clinical text classification- controlled study- entropy- learning algorithm- passive learning- probability- randomization- sample size- task performance- algorithm- artificial intelligence- comparative study- data mining- human- methodology- natural language processing- receiver operating characteristic- Algorithms- Artificial Intelligence- Data Mining- Humans- Natural Language Processing- ROC Curve;English;Article

Eléctrica, Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Concepcián, Concepcián, Chile- Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States- Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States;Background: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. Methods. We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. Results: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning. © 2012 Figueroa et al- licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;algorithm- article- automated pattern recognition- computer assisted diagnosis- human- learning- learning curve- methodology- nonlinear system- predictive value- problem based learning- reproducibility- sample size- statistical analysis- statistical model- statistics- Algorithms- Data Interpretation, Statistical- Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted- Humans- Learning Curve- Models, Statistical- Nonlinear Dynamics- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Predictive Value of Tests- Probability Learning- Problem-Based Learning- Reproducibility of Results- Sample Size- Stochastic Processes;English;Article

Eléctrica San Pedro de Atacama, Los Laureles S/N, San Pedro de Atacama, 1410000, Chile;In this paper, a pricing alternative based on the scheme of Time of Use Pricing (TOUP) is proposed for customers connected to the Cooperativa Eléctrica San Pedro de Atacama (CESPA) microgrid, located in the far north of Chile. With this proposal, the promotion of Demand-Side Management, DSM, aims at optimizing both the use of electric energy and the available infrastructure. The pricing proposal replaces the current tariff scheme based on sections of energy consumption and does not give an incentive for customers to efficiently manage their energy consumption. The proposal considers the creation of time bands and their corresponding tariff formulas, to obtain economic benefits both for customers and the electric company. Study cases consider the operation of a photovoltaic plant of 2 MWp in the electric system of CESPA, which is currently underway. The obtained results report benefits for all parts of the electric market. For customers, favorable pricing up to a 19.1% monthly reduction in electric bills is shown, whereas the company presents an increment in their average monthly income of about 7.7%. © 2022 by the authors.;Costs- Demand side management- Electric utilities- Sales- Smart meters- 'current- Atacama- Cooperativa eléctricum san pedro de atacamum- DSM- Electric energies- Energy-consumption- Far North- Microgrid- PV- Time-of-use pricing- Energy utilization;English;Article

Informática y Ciencias de la Computación, Copiapó, Chile;There are multiple technologies for transporting info-communications between objects and machines for the internet. Two of the most robust and with the highest coverage and support for multiple users are 4G and WiMax IEEE 802.16x. This paper presents a simulation of land coverage of both wireless communication technologies as a broadband communication alternative for new free, private, or supported operators by public institutions, such as municipalities or regional cooperatives. The cases of the cities of Riga, Bucharest, Florianópolis, Santiago, Concepción, and Copiapó were studied. The study uses Radio Mobile GLOBE-BIL software, obtaining propagation coverage graphs on digital SRTM terrain elevation maps released by NASA. This simulation determines the number of antennas required for millions of users in the context of the Internet of Things. It quantifies the square kilometers of wireless propagation coverage that can be technically achieved for each project city. The results show that WiMax supports a more significant number of connected users, has better coverage, and requires fewer antennas. On the other hand, for the propagation coverage indicator, the results for 5 cities are better for WiMax technology than 4G, except for Santiago (Chile), where the best performance is achieved for 4G over WiMax. © 2022, Universidad de Tarapaca.

These sectors obtain the electric energy from distribution networks, so it is essential to check them systematically in order to ensure the power quality according to operational guidelines and national standards. Power quality involves a wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena on the power system, highlighting the harmonics. This paper presents an application based on the k-means clustering to identify similarities in the behavior of the harmonic distortion of voltage and current in distribution networks and its validation and refinement using the rough sets theory. The main result lies in the characterization of those groups of distribution networks by means of their centroids and according to the IEEE Standard 519-2014.

This relates to all energy vectors and can be done through different means. The uptake stage of smart metering and information and communication technologies (ICT) varies in different countries, creating the need for tailored innovative approaches in motivating behavioural change. This paper presents the work carried out within the joint research project ITCity (an ICT platform for sustainable energy ecosystem in smart cities) between the European Union and Latin American Countries. Cooperation of energy researchers and experts in ICT and application developers facilitates adoption of a multipurpose interdisciplinary approach. This work aims at providing the smart city and energy research and innovation community broader understanding of factors influencing adoption of energy efficiency technologies. Different ways of guiding optimal energy use are addressed elaborating on the building blocks for a smart city which consider load patterns based on high resolution, high reporting rate measurements, extensive consumer surveys, available communication solution analysis and end-user interaction with the ICT tool based on gamification principles. © 2021 by the authors.

Depto. de Ing. Eléctrica, Concepción, Chile- Univ. de Atacama, Depto. de Ing. Informática y Cs. de la Computación, Copiapó, Chile- Univ. Tec. Metropolitana, Depto. de Electricidad, Santiago, Chile;Energy efficiency is part of the goals set by governments around the world to reduce the energy footprint and provide sustainable development for all. The arrival of new technologies that allow the monitoring and self-control of electricity consumption within homes, such as smart meters, allow end users to integrate into the intelligent management systems of the electricity grid, by providing information on the flow of energy and prices. This work performs a classification of residential customers from the consumption data obtained from smart meters. For this, a methodology based on the simple K-means algorithm is used to identify patterns of behavior in the consumption of 1179 homes connected to a real low-voltage electricity distribution network in southern Chile equipped with smart meters, and the validation and refinement of the results using numerical measures belonging to the rough sets theory. Final groups are characterized based on their centroids, making possible to convert the large volumes of data collected into useful knowledge, which is beneficial for both the residential customer and the electric power distribution company. The results show that two clusters are the ones that best represent the set of clients. The opportunity to collect consumption data in real time through these devices offers perspectives to optimize public and private policies on electricity distribution. © 2021, Universidad de Tarapaca.

Methodologically, is based on three different stages. The first one involves the selection of the best ARIMA models for each hour of the day, using a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Before this, the removal of the daily and weekly seasonality of the time series is required, as well as the outliers. The second stage is precisely the forecasting activity, and in the last one it is proposed the mechanism of control to get a more automated process. To validate the application, real data sets of two Cuban distribution networks are used. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the load behavior to justify each step. Finally, based on the high precision of the model obtained during the validation period and the graphic results, the effectiveness of this application and its great significance for a better performance of the distribution system is demonstrated. © 2019 IEEE.;Automation- Electric power plant loads- Particle swarm optimization (PSO)- ARIMA modeling- Automated process- Distribution systems- Load forecasting- Novel applications- Online implementation- Short term load forecasting- Validation periods- Forecasting;English;Conference Paper

However, given that environmental conditions change constantly, so does the ampacity of the conductor. This is why line thermal limitation should not be established in a conservative, fixed or invariable way. In the case of Chile, the Independent System Operator (ISO) establishes current-carrying capacity curves. Nevertheless, these are only a function of the ambient temperature in the presence of the sun. Such methodology is insufficient since it does not consider the effect of wind as the main conductor cooling mechanism. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new approach for a probabilistic current calculation model based on dynamic thermal rating. This approach accounts for the spatial and temporal variation of weather conditions along a line. The approach maximizes the line's current capacity by employing an iterative process based on the span identification that limits the conductor ampacity. Furthermore, the approach includes temperature restrictions to avoid conductor mechanical problems. The model is applied in the Chilean system, particularly to the Maitencillo–Nogales 220 kV transmission path. The new current limitations established by the proposed approach are compared to those set by the Chilean ISO and show significant increases in the current-carrying capacity of the lines and hence a better use of NCRE generation to lower production costs and CO 2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;Electric lines- Electric utilities- Iterative methods- Meteorology- Ampacity- Dynamic thermal ratings- Economic benefits- Overhead transmission lines- Probabilistic modeling- Static thermal rating- Dynamics;English;Article

This mainly due to the high solar irradiation levels available and governmental backing of the technology. However, this growth is predominantly due to large-scale utility size power plants, being distributed generation on residential and commercial installations only a small fraction of it. This reduced growth on small scale PV systems is primarily attributed to the lack of qualified designers and installers, and the low awareness among the general public on the benefits of solar generation. To help tackle this problem, the development of an integrated e-learning platform is under way, which will provide differentiated courses for each objective group.

However, this requires appropriate measurement devices and an M2M control-communication alternative that offers real-time visualization of the information. This article proposes a prototype of the home electric power consumption management platform, as an advance in generating a model for future Smart Grid. Therefore, the research implements smart socket devices and a coordinator of the communication of a home area network between these measuring devices to have an intelligent control of electric power. As a result, real-time data of the defined electrical parameters have been obtained. This information has been stored in the Internet cloud, also allowing remotely programming and controlling these measurement devices.

These algorithms are based on the symmetrical components (0-zero, 1-positive and 2-negative sequences) of the 3-phases currents. Due to the power flows generated by the DG the positive sequence current argument is unforeseeable, thus it is not possible to use only the positive sequence. Then, we first propose in this paper an algorithm using the I2/I0 ratio to locate a phase-to-ground fault upstream or downstream the detector. The second algorithm measures the zero and positive sequence components of the fifth harmonic of the current and calculates the I0_5/I1_5 ratio. The performances of these algorithms are analysed for several DG power, fault resistance, capacitive current and neutral grounding (resistive and compensative grounding). The fluctuations of the phasors measurements is also taken into account in the range ±5% for the modulus and ±5° for the argument. The present paper shows that these algorithms can be reliable in the major part of the studied cases. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a distributed and scalable algorithm for yielding an optimal powergrid topology that minimizes the QoS metric called energy-not-supplied (ENS) by the distribution grid. The ENS is minimized by constructing both local, independent minimum weight spanning trees (MWSTs) and a global yet unique MWST for the entire grid. At each step of the distributed algorithm, agents exchange information about their local MWSTs in order to coordinately construct the global MWST. In addition, the distributed algorithm exploits heuristics to supply extra decision criteria to the agents constructing the MWST of the power grid. © 2010 IEEE.;Optimization- Quality of service- Reliability- Software agents- Topology- Distribution grid- Distribution power grids- Energy not supplied- Energy not supplied (ENS)- Greedy algorithms- Minimum weight spanning trees- Reconfiguration- Scalable algorithms- Electric power transmission networks;English;Conference Paper

The algorithms are derived from a graph-theoretic model for the MV-DNs and an iterative formulation for the ENS. Given a DN composed of n loads, GRA yields an initial radial topology with minimal ENS after executing n-1 iterations of a multistage decision process. Next, GRA executes a verification algorithm to evaluate all of those candidate topologies randomly discarded during the decision process. After the second stage, GRA announces the optimal topology as well as the minimum ENS of the system. The second algorithm proposed is called FGRA and is obtained when heuristic graph compression is performed throughout the execution of GRA. The aforementioned graph compression reduces the dimension of the problem, thereby producing substantial savings in computing time at the expense of possibly achieving a suboptimal solution. © 2008 IEEE.;Computational methods- Distributed parameter networks- Distribution of goods- Electric loads- Electric network topology- Electric power distribution- Internet protocols- Metropolitan area networks- Optimization- Packet networks- Pulsatile flow- Reliability- Reliability analysis- Restoration- Topology- Algorithm design and analysis- Distribution networks- Energy not supplied- Greedy algorithms- Load flow analysis- Network topology- Reconfiguration- Heuristic algorithms;English;Article

Here, the position of the reclosers has been modeled using a linear approximation. The objective of this paper is to minimize the average interruption frequency per installed power. According to the current electric regulation in Chile, this index is the metric used to regulate and classify the performance of utilities. In the analysis a novel concept of Distance Factor between the main feeder and a branch feeder was introduced. This concept can be utilized as a theoretical limit for the number of switches to install on the main feeder. In addition, based upon the service history of the line, the distance factor determines if a certain line must be economically assessed like a new feeder so that the aforementioned performance index of average interruption frequency per installed power is minimized.;-;Spanish;Article

Specifically, deep learning models have faced these challenges, achieving excellent results. In particular, the trend of using single-column Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) has increased in recent years. A typical architecture that meets these characteristics is the autoencoder. However, this model presents an intrinsic difficulty: the search for the optimal dimensionality of the latent space. In order to alleviate such difficulty, we propose a dual architecture consisting of two cascaded autoencoders. The first autoencoder is responsible for carrying out the masked reconstruction of the original images, whereas the second obtains crowd maps from the outputs of the first one. In this way, our architecture improves the location of people and crowds in Focal Inverse Distance Transform (FIDT) maps, resulting in more accurate count estimates than estimates obtained through a single autoencoder architecture. © 2013 IEEE.;Architecture- Deep learning- Inverse problems- Network architecture- Neural networks- Auto encoders- Cascaded autoencoder- Convolutional neural network- Crowd localization/counting- Deep learning- Density maps- Distance transforms- Focal inverse distance transform map- Localisation- Time of crisis- Convolution;English;Article

Electronic properties, adsorption energies of H, C, and CHx species, and the energetics of the hydrogenation of surface C atom to methane are studied for (100) and (111) surfaces of monometallic Ni and Co, and bimetallic NiCo. The bimetallic catalyst exhibits a Co→Ni electron donation and a concomitant increase in the magnetization of Co atoms. The CHx species resulting from sequential hydrogenation are more stable on Co than on Ni atoms of the NiCo surfaces due to more favorable (C-H)–Co agostic interactions. These interactions and differences between Co and Ni sites are more significant for (111) than for (100) bimetallic surfaces. On (111) surfaces, CH is the most stable species, and the first hydrogenation of C atom exhibits the highest barrier, followed by the CH3 hydrogenation steps. In contrast, on (100) surfaces, surface C atom is the most stable species and CH2 or *CH3 hydrogenations exhibit the highest barriers. The Gibbs free energy profiles suggest that C removal on (111) surfaces is thermodynamically favorable and exhibits a lower barrier than on the (100) surfaces. Thus, the (100) surfaces, especially Ni(100), are more prone to C poisoning. The NiCo(100) surfaces exhibit weaker binding of C and CHx species than Ni(100) and Co(100), which improves C poisoning resistance and lowers hydrogenation barriers. These results show that the electronic effects of alloying Ni and Co strongly depend on the local site composition and geometry. © 2022 by the authors.;-;English;Article

Hence, a detailed mechanistic study was performed on SiO2-supported mono- and bimetallic NiCo catalysts by combining kinetic, spectroscopic and isotopic measurements under methanation conditions, to explain the effect of catalysts composition on the CO2 hydrogenation rate and selectivity toward CO(g) and CH4. It was observed an anti-synergistic effect for the CO2 hydrogenation turnover rate on the NiCo bimetallic catalysts, which is attributed to the inhibition of the CH4 formation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces- on the other hand, the CO(g) formation turnover rate values resulted close to the weighted average values and increases linearly with the cobalt content in the catalysts. The results suggest that the two reaction products are formed through parallel routes with different rate-determining steps, involving two types of active sites where carbonyl species adsorb differently: strongly adsorbed species (CO*) lead to CH4 formation via the H-assisted C–O bond dissociation while weakly adsorbed (CO⊕) desorbs to produce CO(g). This was consistent with the inverse H/D kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) observed for methane formation and the KIE values close to unity for CO(g) formation over all catalysts. Operando-infrared measurements suggested that weakly and strongly adsorbed carbonyl species are in quasi-equilibrium at the catalyst surface. It was proposed a sequence of elementary steps for CO2 methanation reaction on Ni, Co and NiCo catalysts, from which a Langmuir-Hinshelwood models for CO(g) and CH4 formation rates were derived. These models properly represent the kinetic data for products formation rates, and content physiochemically-consistent parameters, which point out that the CH4 formation from CO2 hydrogenation can be boosted over a catalytic surface that strongly adsorbs CO, hampers its transformation into CO⊕ and shows a high hydrogenation rate of carbonyl species. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.;Binary alloys- Catalyst selectivity- Cobalt- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy- Hydrogenation- Isotopes- Kinetics- Methanation- Reaction intermediates- Reaction rates- Silica- Bimetallics- CH 4- Elementary steps- Hydrogenation rate- Isotopic measurement- Kinetic isotopic effects- Ni-Co catalysts- Turnover rate- [carbonyl- Carbon dioxide;English;Article

Firstly, nanobiosensors were designed and synthesized by chemically bonding gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with aptamer bioreceptors highly selective for four widely used antibiotics in the field of veterinary medicine, namely, Kanamycin, Ampicillin, Oxytetracycline and Sulfadimethoxine. When molecules of the antibiotics are present in the milk sample, the interaction with the aptamers induces random AuNP aggregation. This phenomenon modifies the initial absorption spectrum of the milk sample without antibiotics, producing spectral features that indicate both the presence of antibiotics and, to some extent, its concentration. Secondly, we designed and constructed an electro-opto-mechanic device that performs automatic high-resolution spectral data acquisition in a wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm. Thirdly, the acquired spectra were processed by a machine-learning algorithm that is embedded into the acquisition hardware to determine the presence and concentration ranges of the antibiotics. Our approach outperformed state-of-the-art standardized techniques (based on the 520/620 nm ratio) for antibiotic detection, both in speed and in sensitivity. © 2020 by the authors.

A., Concepción, 1234, Chile- Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, 4030000, Chile;We present an instrument based on commodity embedded hardware, that implements an automatic procedure for early skin-cancer screening using dynamic thermal imaging. The procedure leverages image segmentation in the visible range and real-time multimodal registration to compute the temperature recovery curve (TRC) of suspicious skin lesions using thermal infrared video. The instrument implements two algorithms that infer the malignancy of the lesion from the computed TRCs. The first algorithm assumes that the TRCs are deterministic and infers the malignancy from the distance between the TRC of the suspicious lesion and its surrounding skin, which is assumed to be healthy tissue. The second algorithm models the TRC of the lesion as a random process and uses detection theory to statistically infer its malignancy from the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of its covariance function. We built a prototype of the instrument using a Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ board, which acquires a visible-range image of the lesion at the beginning of the procedure and performs image segmentation in 62ms. Operating on a 400 × 400-pixel region-of-interest within the infrared video, the board performs frame-by-frame multimodal image registration and generates the TRCs in real time at more than 37 frames per second, thus eliminating the need to store video data for off-line processing. The statistical detection algorithm, which yields the best results, runs in 1.07s at the end of the procedure, and achieves a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 95% on a dataset of 116 volunteer subjects. © 2013 IEEE.;Classification (of information)- Dermatology- Diseases- Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions- Embedded software- Infrared imaging- Random processes- Signal detection- Thermography (imaging)- Automatic procedures- Detection algorithm- Multimodal image registration- Multimodal registration- Skin cancers- Statistical detection algorithms- Temperature recovery- Thermal infrared videos- Image segmentation;English;Article

This is accomplished by means of a custom-made mid-wave infrared imager fitted with appropriate infrared optics. The microscopic thermal images enable us to capture spatial and temporal thermal information emitted from the microscopic finger pad's blood vessels and irrigation system, spatially attenuated by the finger pad's skin morphology. As a consequence, we can acquire and extract features that visual-spectrum microscopes or regular infrared imagers are not able to disclose. The thermoregulation response is acquired by exposing to a thermal stress the finger pads of voluntary subjects, while a microscopic infrared sequence was recorded. We used standard infrared imaging and signal processing techniques to extract the thermoregulation curves of the infrared sequences, and the thermal morphology features were estimated from the same imagery. One of the key findings of this paper is that three distinctive index finger pads infrared morphology patterns were identified, and important insights of the thermal behavior of the micro-spatial finger pad anatomy were observed for the very first time. © 2013 IEEE.;Blood vessels- Infrared imaging- Infrared radiation- Microscopic examination- Morphology- Optical data processing- Palmprint recognition- Thermoanalysis- Thermography (imaging)- Fingerprint Recognition- Infrared microscopy- Irrigation systems- Microscopic views- Mid wave infrared (MWIR)- Signal processing technique- Spatial morphologies- Thermal behaviors- Image processing;English;Article

We correct both nuisances using a novel, recursive method that combines the constant range nonuniformity correction algorithm with a frame-by-frame deconvolution approach. The ability of the method to jointly compensate for both nonuniformity noise and blur is demonstrated using two different real mid-wavelength infrared microscopic video sequences, which were captured from two microscopic living organisms using a Janos-Sofradir mid-wavelength infrared microscopy setup.

The most commonly used method for AuNP synthesis in aqueous solution is the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) with trisodium citrate. We have observed variations in the pH and in the concentration of the gold colloidal suspension synthesized under standard conditions, verifying a reduction in the reaction yield by around 46% from pH 5.3 (2.4 nM) to pH 4.7 (1.29 nM). Citrate-capped AuNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, TEM, EDS, and zeta-potential measurements, revealing a linear correlation between pH and the concentration of the generated AuNPs. This result can be attributed to the adverse effect of protons both on citrate oxidation and on citrate adsorption onto the gold surface, which is required to form the stabilization layer. Overall, this study provides insight into the effect of the pH over the synthesis performance of the method, which would be of particular interest from the point of view of large-scale manufacturing processes. © 2018 by the authors.

Currently, high speed cameras and thermocouples are used separately to evaluate these parameters. We used a low-noise infrared camera to evaluate both the temperature and velocity of the emitted plume from pMDIs. Additionally, we investigated whether the fine particle fraction (FPF) is affected when time between actuations is varied. We tested three different albuterol sulfate pMDIs: ProAir® HFA, Proventil® HFA, and Ventolin® HFA. The plume and aerodynamic characteristics from these pMDIs were evaluated, after varying the time between actuations (15, 30, 60, and 120 s), using the infrared camera and a next generation impactor, respectively. The aerodynamic characteristics were evaluated with and without a valved holding chamber (VHC). ProAir HFA had the softest plume followed by Proventil HFA and Ventolin HFA. Further, Ventolin HFA was slightly cooler and had significantly lower FPF than ProAir HFA and Proventil HFA. All inhalers had higher FPF when used with VHC. Further, we observed that the time between actuations affected the FPF across pMDIs. Moreover, generalized guidelines suggesting one-minute interval between actuations for pMDIs should be reconsidered, with and without a VHC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;procaterol- salbutamol- salbutamol- aerosol- Article- camera- controlled study- human- infrared radiation- metered dose inhaler- particle size- plume- practice guideline- priority journal- suspension- temperature- velocity- inhalational drug administration- nebulizer- pharmaceutics- Administration, Inhalation- Aerosols- Albuterol- Metered Dose Inhalers- Nebulizers and Vaporizers- Particle Size- Technology, Pharmaceutical;English;Article

Presently, visual inspection by a dermatologist has good sensitivity (> 90%) but poor specificity (< 10%), especially for melanoma, which leads to a high number of unnecessary biopsies. Here we use dynamic thermal imaging (DTI) to demonstrate a rapid, accurate and non-invasive imaging system for detection of skin cancer. In DTI, the lesion is cooled down and the thermal recovery is recorded using infrared imaging. The thermal recovery curves of the suspected lesions are then utilized in the context of continuous-time detection theory in order to define an optimal statistical decision rule such that the sensitivity of the algorithm is guaranteed to be at a maximum for every prescribed false-alarm probability. The proposed methodology was tested in a pilot study including 140 human subjects demonstrating a sensitivity in excess of 99% for a prescribed specificity in excess of 99% for detection of skin cancer.

We test the system on a combination of visible and long-wave infrared image sequences, but it can be easily extended to setups operating in different sections of the spectrum. Image registration is performed by matching common features between each frame of a visible image to each frame of an infrared image sequence to estimate a projective transformation between them. The parameters of this transformation are estimated recursively on line with the video, thus enabling image registration in real time. The algorithm is implemented using a combination of embedded software and dedicated hardware units on a heterogeneous reconfigurable system-on-a-chip. The hardware performs feature detection and extraction, while the software estimates the transformation parameters and maps each visible video frame onto the infrared image coordinates.

Image registration is performed by matching common features between each frame of a visible image to each frame of an infrared image sequence, in order to estimate an affine transformation between each pair of images. The parameters of this affine transformation are estimated recursively on line with the video, thus enabling image registration in real time. The registration algorithm is implemented using a combination of embedded software and dedicated hardware units on a heterogeneous reconfigurable system-on-a-chip. The hardware performs feature detection and extraction, whereas the software estimates the transformation parameters and maps each infrared video frame onto the visible image coordinates. Our prototype implementation runs with a 135MHz clock, consumes 1.8W and utilizes 29% and 54% of the configurable logic and hardware multiplier units available on the chip, respectively. © 2016 IEEE.;Computer hardware- Computer vision- Embedded systems- Extraction- Feature extraction- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Hardware- Image matching- Image registration- Infrared devices- Infrared imaging- Infrared radiation- Parameter estimation- Program processors- Structural design- System-on-chip- Systems analysis- Video signal processing- Embedded system architectures- Long wave infrared- Multimodal registration- Prototype implementations- Registration algorithms- Spatio temporal features- Transformation parameters- Video processing- Image processing;English;Conference Paper

Four devices are fabricated and characterized with varying composition for barriers adjacent to quantum dots and away from quantum dots. Effects of these ""proximity"" and ""remote"" barriers are studied by comparing photoluminescence, responsivity, dark current, background-limited operating temperature, activation energy, and detectivity. The growth mechanism for a conformal coverage of quantum dots with proximity barriers is described and supported with reflection high-energy electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy images. It is shown that proximity barriers and remote barriers influence the characteristics of the detector very differently, with increases in proximity barrier energy leading to higher responsivity and lower dark current, while remote barriers reduce the responsivity and dark currents simultaneously. It is demonstrated that confinement enhancing barriers as proximity barriers optimize the SNR at low bias range, suitable for focal plane array applications. © 2012 IEEE.";Barrier energy- Barriers- Conformal coverage- Detectivity- Dots in a wells- Growth mechanisms- Infrared photodetector- Low bias- Operating temperature- Quantum dots in a well (DWELL)- Responsivity- Selection Rules- Systematic study- Transmission electron microscopy images- Activation energy- Dark currents- Quantum well infrared photodetectors- Transmission electron microscopy- Semiconductor quantum dots;English;Article

Even though this nonuniformity noise can be removed after a blackbody calibration procedure, it tends to reappear due to the intrinsic nature of infrared sensing. Online nonuniformity correction techniques have been employed for denoising and tracking the drift, also avoiding to halt normal camera operations. In this paper, a new reference-free infrared imaging quality metric is presented. The main purpose of the proposed metric is to evaluate the quality of the denoised infrared images in real-time, exchanging the typical need of calibration sources by the knowledge of the fixed-pattern noise statistics. We compare the performance of the proposed metric against standard reference-based and reference-free metrics, using a variety of real-time nonuniformity correction techniques. Results show that the new metric is able to track the nonuniformity correction performance, constantly evaluating the quality of the denoised infrared image sequences.;Blackbody calibration- Calibration source- De-noising- Fixed pattern noise- Focal planes- Image enhacement- Image quality index- Imaging quality- Infrared focal plane arrays- Infrared image sequence- Infrared images- Infrared sensing- Intrinsic nature- Nonuniformity correction- Nonuniformity noise- Calibration- Cybernetics- Image quality- Information science- Knowledge management- Infrared imaging;English;Conference Paper

The FPN refers to the inability of the photodetectors in the focal-plane array to render a uniform output image when a uniform-intensity scene is being imaged. We present a noise-cancellation-based algorithm that compensates for the additive component of the FPN. The proposed method relies on the assumption that a source of noise correlated to the additive FPN is available to the IR camera. An important feature of the algorithm is that all the calculations are reduced to a simple equation, which allows for the bias compensation of the raw imagery. The algorithm performance is tested using real IR image sequences and is compared to some classical methodologies. © 2008 Optical Society of America.;Focusing- Infrared imaging- Spurious signal noise- Algorithm performance- Classical methodologies- Fixed pattern noise- Important features- Infrared focal plane arrays- IR image sequences- Noise cancellation- Nonuniformity correction algorithm- Signal denoising;English;Article

The proposed NUC method compensates for the additive component of the FPN statistically processing the read-out signal using a noise-cancellation system. The main assumption of the method is that a source of noise correlated to the additive noise of the IRFPA is available to the system. Under this assumption, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is designed to synthesize an estimate of the additive noise. Moreover, exploiting the fact that the assumed source of noise is constant in time, we derive a simple expression to calculate the estimate of the additive noise. Finally, the estimate is subtracted to the raw IR imagery to obtain the corrected version of the images. The performance of the proposed system and its ability to compensate for the FPN are tested with infrared images corrupted by both real and simulated nonuniformity.;Additive noise- Algorithms- FIR filters- Infrared imaging- Sensors- Fixed-pattern noise- Noise-cancellation system- Nonuniformity correction- Focal plane arrays;English;Conference Paper

In this study we aimed to compare brain-behavior relationships, using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the most reliable and sensitive cognitive measure in MS, measured from patients seen via telehealth versus in-person. Methods: SDMT was administered to individuals with MS either in-person (N=60, mean age=39.7) or remotely via video conference (N=51, mean age=47.4). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was collected in 3-Tesla scanners. Using 3-dimensional T1 images cerebral, cortical, deep gray, cerebral white matter and thalamic nuclei volumes were calculated. Using a meta-analysis approach with an interaction term for participant group, individual regression models were run for each MRI measure having SDMT scores as the outcome variable in each model. In addition, the correlation and average difference between In-person and Remote group associations across the MRI measures were calculated. Finally, for each MRI variable I2 score was quantified to test the heterogeneity between the groups. Results: Administration modality did not affect the association of SDMT performance with MRI measures. Brain tissue volumes showing high associations with the SDMT scores in one group also showed high associations in the other (r = 0.83- 95% CI = [0.07, 0.86]). The average difference between the In-person and the Remote group associations was not significant (βRemote - βIn-person = 0.14, 95% CI = [-0.04, 0.34]). Across MRI measures, the average I2 value was 14%, reflecting very little heterogeneity in the relationship of SDMT performance to brain volume. Conclusion: We found consistent relationships to neural correlates across in-person and remote SDMT administration modalities. Hence, our study extended the findings of the previous studies demonstrating the feasibility of remote administration of the SDMT. © 2022;adult- Article- brain cortex- brain size- controlled study- feasibility study- female- gray matter- human- major clinical study- male- multiple sclerosis- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- outcome variable- sensitivity analysis- symbol digit modalities test- thalamus nucleus- three-dimensional imaging- videoconferencing- volumetry- white matter- brain- complication- diagnostic imaging- meta analysis- middle aged- neuropsychological test- procedures- reproducibility- Adult- Brain- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Middle Aged- Multiple Sclerosis- Neuropsychological Tests- Reproducibility of Results;English;Article

While this rearrangement only impacts the ends of the long pathways, it may affect most of the trajectory of the short bundles. Therefore, mapping the short fibers of the human brain using diffusion-based tractography requires a dedicated strategy to overcome the variability of the folding patterns. In this paper, we propose a fiber-based stratification strategy splitting the population into homogeneous groups for disentangling the superficial white matter bundle organization. This strategy introduces a new refined fiber distance which includes angular considerations for inferring fine-grained atlases of the short bundles surrounding a specific sulcus and a subtractogram distance that quantifies the similitude between fiber sets of two different subjects. The stratification splits the population into groups with similar regional fiber organization using manifold learning. We first successfully test the hypothesis that the main source of variability of the regional fiber organization is the variability of the regional folding pattern. Then, in each group, we proceed with the automatic identification of the most stable bundles, at a higher granularity level than what can be achieved with the non-stratified whole population, enabling the disentanglement of the very variable configuration of the short fibers. Finally, the method searches for bundle correspondence across groups to build a population level atlas. As a proof of concept, the atlas refinement achieved by this strategy is illustrated for the fibers that surround the central sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus using the HCP dataset. © 2022 The Author(s);adult- article- case report- central sulcus- clinical article- diffusion weighted imaging- female- human- human experiment- male- manifold learning- proof of concept- superior temporal sulcus- tractography- white matter- writing- brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- image processing- learning- myelinated nerve- Brain- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Learning- Nerve Fibers, Myelinated- White Matter;English;Article

United States;Although machine learning (ML) has shown promise across disciplines, out-of-sample generalizability is concerning. This is currently addressed by sharing multi-site data, but such centralization is challenging/infeasible to scale due to various limitations. Federated ML (FL) provides an alternative paradigm for accurate and generalizable ML, by only sharing numerical model updates. Here we present the largest FL study to-date, involving data from 71 sites across 6 continents, to generate an automatic tumor boundary detector for the rare disease of glioblastoma, reporting the largest such dataset in the literature (n = 6, 314). We demonstrate a 33% delineation improvement for the surgically targetable tumor, and 23% for the complete tumor extent, over a publicly trained model. We anticipate our study to: 1) enable more healthcare studies informed by large diverse data, ensuring meaningful results for rare diseases and underrepresented populations, 2) facilitate further analyses for glioblastoma by releasing our consensus model, and 3) demonstrate the FL effectiveness at such scale and task-complexity as a paradigm shift for multi-site collaborations, alleviating the need for data-sharing. © 2022, The Author(s).;cancer- health care- machine learning- tumor- glioblastoma- human- information dissemination- machine learning- rare disease- Big Data- Glioblastoma- Humans- Information Dissemination- Machine Learning- Rare Diseases;English;Article

Methods: Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity (MD) values from SWM bundles across the cortex and major deep white matter (DWM) tracts were extracted from 29 early MS patients and 31 age- and sex-matched HC. Thickness of 68 cortical regions and resting-state functional-connectivity (RSFC) among them were calculated. The distribution of structural and functional metrics between groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Utilizing a machine learning method (adaptive boosting), 6 models were built based on: 1-SWM, 2-DWM, 3-SWM and DWM, 4-cortical thickness, or 5-RSFC measures. In model 6, all features from previous models were incorporated. The models were trained with nested 5-folds cross-validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCroc) values were calculated to evaluate classification performance of each model. Permutation tests were used to compare the AUCroc values. Results: Patients had higher MD in SWM bundles including insula, inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, superior and medial temporal, and pre- and post-central cortices (p &lt-.05). No group differences were found for any other MRI metric. The model incorporating SWM and DWM features provided the best classification (AUCroc = 0.75). The SWM model provided higher AUCroc (0.74), compared to DWM (0.63), cortical thickness (0.67), RSFC (0.63), and all-features (0.68) models (p &lt-.001 for all).

However, their description is essential to understand human brain dysfunction and better characterize the human brain connectome. In this work, we present a multi-subject atlas of short association fibers, which was computed using a superficial white matter bundle identification method based on fiber clustering. To create the atlas, we used probabilistic tractography from one hundred subjects from the HCP database, aligned with non-linear registration. The method starts with an intra-subject clustering of short fibers (30-85 mm). Based on a cortical atlas, the intra-subject cluster centroids from all subjects are segmented to identify the centroids connecting each region of interest (ROI) of the atlas. To reduce computational load, the centroids from each ROI group are randomly separated into ten subgroups. Then, an inter-subject hierarchical clustering is applied to each centroid subgroup, followed by a second level of clustering to select the most-reproducible clusters across subjects for each ROI group. Finally, the clusters are labeled according to the regions that they connect, and clustered to create the final bundle atlas. The resulting atlas is composed of 525 bundles of superficial short association fibers along the whole brain, with 384 bundles connecting pairs of different ROIs and 141 bundles connecting portions of the same ROI. The reproducibility of the bundles was verified using automatic segmentation on three different tractogram databases. Results for deterministic and probabilistic tractography data show high reproducibility, especially for probabilistic tractography in HCP data. In comparison to previous work, our atlas features a higher number of bundles and greater cortical surface coverage. © 2022;adult- article- connectome- controlled study- female- hierarchical clustering- human- human experiment- major clinical study- male- reproducibility- tractography- white matter- brain- cluster analysis- diagnostic imaging- image processing- procedures- Brain- Cluster Analysis- Connectome- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Reproducibility of Results- White Matter;English;Article

As mobile devices are widely used among users and their technology shows a continuous improvement in performance, different types of applications have been designed to help users in different work areas. Results: We present, ABrainVis, an Android mobile tool that allows users to visualize different types of brain images, such as white matter diffusion tractographies, represented as fibers in 3D, segmented fiber bundles, MRI 3D images as rendered volumes and slices, and meshes. The tool enables users to choose and combine different types of brain imaging data to provide visual anatomical context for specific visualization needs. ABrainVis provides high performance over a wide range of Android devices, including tablets and cell phones using medium and large tractography datasets. Interesting visualizations including brain tumors and arteries, along with fiber, are given as examples of case studies using ABrainVis. Conclusions: The functionality, flexibility and performance of ABrainVis tool introduce an improvement in user experience enabling neurophysicians and neuroscientists fast visualization of large tractography datasets, as well as the ability to incorporate other brain imaging data such as MRI volumes and meshes, adding anatomical contextual information. © 2021, The Author(s).;Brain mapping- Data visualization- Large dataset- Magnetic resonance imaging- User experience- Visualization- Brain structure- Brain-imaging data- Contextual information- Continuous improvements- Fast visualization- Fiber bundles- Visualization and analysis- White matter- Android (operating system)- brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- image processing- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- three-dimensional imaging- white matter- Brain- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Imaging, Three-Dimensional- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- White Matter;English;Article

In patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, both alterations in cerebral connectivity and an increased threshold for conscious perception have been reported. The implications of abnormal structural connectivity for disrupted conscious access and the relationship between these two deficits and psychopathology remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which structural connectivity is correlated with consciousness threshold, particularly in psychosis. We used a visual masking paradigm to measure consciousness threshold, and diffusion MRI tractography to assess structural connectivity in 97 humans of either sex with varying degrees of psychosis: healthy control subjects (n = 46), schizophrenia patients (n = 25), and bipolar disorder patients with (n = 17) and without (n = 9) a history of psychosis. Patients with psychosis (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic features) had an elevated masking threshold compared with control subjects and bipolar disorder patients without psychotic features. Masking threshold correlated negatively with the mean general fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts exclusively within the GNW network (inferior frontaloccipital fasciculus, cingulum, and corpus callosum). Mediation analysis demonstrated that alterations in longdistance connectivity were associated with an increased masking threshold, which in turn was linked to psychotic symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that long-distance structural connectivity within the GNW plays a crucial role in conscious access, and that conscious access may mediate the association between impaired structural connectivity and psychosis.

Previous segmentation methods use the maximum Euclidean distance between corresponding points of the subject fibers and the atlas centroids. However, this scheme might include noisy fibers. Here, we propose a three step approach to discard noisy fibers improving the identification of fibers. The first step applies a fiber clustering and the segmentation is performed between the centroids of the clusters and the atlas centroids. This step removes outliers and enables a better identification of fibers with similar shapes. The second step applies a fiber filter based on two different fiber similarities. One is the Symmetrized Segment-Path Distance (SSPD) over 2D ISOMAP and the other is an adapted version of SSPD for 3D space. The last step eliminates noisy fibers by removing those that connect regions that are far from the main atlas bundle connections. We perform an experimental evaluation using ten subjects of the Human Connectome (HCP) database. The evaluation only considers the bundles connecting precentral and postcentral gyri, with a total of seven bundles per hemisphere. For comparison, the bundles of the ten subjects were manually segmented. Bundles segmented with our method were evaluated in terms of similarity to manually segmented bundles and the final number of fibers. The results show that our approach obtains bundles with a higher similarity score than the state-of-the-art method and maintains a similar number of fibers.Clinical relevance - Many brain pathologies or disorders can occur in specific regions of the SWM automatic segmentation of reliable SWM bundles would help applications to clinical research. © 2021 IEEE.;Clinical research- Medical imaging- A.Fibres- Automatic segmentations- Euclidean distance- Fibre bundle- Probabilistic tractography- Probabilistics- Segmentation methods- Tractography- White matter- White matter fibers- Fibers- brain- cluster analysis- connectome- diagnostic imaging- human- myelinated nerve- white matter- Brain- Cluster Analysis- Connectome- Humans- Nerve Fibers, Myelinated- White Matter;English;Conference Paper

These methods enable exploratory bundle inspection using visualization and other methods that require identifying brain white matter structures in individuals or a population. Some applications, such as real-time visualization and inter-subject clustering, need fast and high-quality intra-subject clustering algorithms. This work proposes a parallel algorithm using a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) for fiber clustering based on the FFClust algorithm. The proposed GPGPU implementation exploits data parallelism using both multicore and GPU fine-grained parallelism present in commodity architectures, including current laptops and desktop computers. Our approach implements all FFClust steps in parallel, improving execution times in all of them. In addition, our parallel approach includes a parallel Kmeans++ algorithm implementation and defines a new variant of Kmeans++ to reduce the impact of choosing outliers as initial centroids. The results show that our approach provides clustering quality results very similar to FFClust, and it requires an execution time of 3.5 s for processing about a million fibers, achieving a speedup of 11.5 times compared to FFClust. © Copyright © 2021 Goicovich, Olivares, Román, Vázquez, Poupon, Mangin, Guevara and Hernández.;acceleration- algorithm- Article- clustering algorithm- computer language- corpus callosum- diffusion weighted imaging- fiber clustering method- fractional anisotropy- image segmentation- learning algorithm- machine learning- metagenomics- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- pyramidal tract- signal noise ratio- tractography- white matter;English;Article

The method is based on the structural connectivity obtained from representative brain fiber clusters, calculated via an inter-subject clustering scheme. Preliminary regions were defined from cluster-cortical mesh intersection points. The final parcellation was obtained using parcel probability maps to model and integrate the connectivity information of all subjects, and graphs to represent the overlap between parcels. Two inter-subject clustering schemes were tested, generating a total of 171 and 109 parcels, respectively. The resulting parcels were quantitatively compared with three state-of-the-art atlases. The best parcellation returned 69 parcels with a Dice similarity coefficient greater than 0.5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based cortex parcellation method based on whole-brain inter-subject fiber clustering. © 2021 IEEE.;adult- algorithm- article- brain cortex- diffusion- probability;English;Conference Paper

However, like other analyses of complex data, there is considerable variability in segmentation protocols and techniques. This can result in different reconstructions of the same intended white matter pathways, which directly affects tractography results, quantification, and interpretation. In this study, we aim to evaluate and quantify the variability that arises from different protocols for bundle segmentation. Through an open call to users of fiber tractography, including anatomists, clinicians, and algorithm developers, 42 independent teams were given processed sets of human whole-brain streamlines and asked to segment 14 white matter fascicles on six subjects. In total, we received 57 different bundle segmentation protocols, which enabled detailed volume-based and streamline-based analyses of agreement and disagreement among protocols for each fiber pathway. Results show that even when given the exact same sets of underlying streamlines, the variability across protocols for bundle segmentation is greater than all other sources of variability in the virtual dissection process, including variability within protocols and variability across subjects. In order to foster the use of tractography bundle dissection in routine clinical settings, and as a fundamental analytical tool, future endeavors must aim to resolve and reduce this heterogeneity. Although external validation is needed to verify the anatomical accuracy of bundle dissections, reducing heterogeneity is a step towards reproducible research and may be achieved through the use of standard nomenclature and definitions of white matter bundles and well-chosen constraints and decisions in the dissection process. © 2021;adult- algorithm- article- clinical article- controlled study- dissection- female- human- human experiment- male- nomenclature- quantitative analysis- tractography- validation process- white matter- algorithm- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- dissection- image processing- nerve tract- procedures- white matter- Algorithms- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Dissection- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Neural Pathways- White Matter;English;Article

Tractography datasets contain 3D streamlines that can be analyzed to study the main brain white matter tracts. Fiber clustering methods have been used to automatically group similar fibers into clusters. However, due to inter-subject variability and artifacts, the resulting clusters are difficult to process for finding common connections across subjects, specially for superficial white matter. Methods: We present an automatic method for labeling of short association bundles on a group of subjects. The method is based on an intra-subject fiber clustering that generates compact fiber clusters. Posteriorly, the clusters are labeled based on the cortical connectivity of the fibers, taking as reference the Desikan-Killiany atlas, and named according to their relative position along one axis. Finally, two different strategies were applied and compared for the labeling of inter-subject bundles: a matching with the Hungarian algorithm, and a well-known fiber clustering algorithm, called QuickBundles. Results: Individual labeling was executed over four subjects, with an execution time of 3.6 min. An inspection of individual labeling based on a distance measure showed good correspondence among the four tested subjects. Two inter-subject labeling were successfully implemented and applied to 20 subjects and compared using a set of distance thresholds, ranging from a conservative value of 10 mm to a moderate value of 21 mm. Hungarian algorithm led to a high correspondence, but low reproducibility for all the thresholds, with 96 s of execution time. QuickBundles led to better correspondence, reproducibility and short execution time of 9 s. Hence, the whole processing for the inter-subject labeling over 20 subjects takes 1.17 h. Conclusion: We implemented a method for the automatic labeling of short bundles in individuals, based on an intra-subject clustering and the connectivity of the clusters with the cortex. The labels provide useful information for the visualization and analysis of individual connections, which is very difficult without any additional information. Furthermore, we provide two fast inter-subject bundle labeling methods. The obtained clusters could be used for performing manual or automatic connectivity analysis in individuals or across subjects. © 2020 The Author(s).;Brain- Fibers- Magnetic resonance imaging- Automatic connectivity- Automatic labeling- Clustering methods- Conservative value- Hungarian algorithm- Relative positions- Visualization and analysis- White matter tracts- Clustering algorithms- adult- article- artifact- clinical article- clustering algorithm- female- human- human experiment- male- reproducibility- tractography- white matter- writing- algorithm- automation- brain- cluster analysis- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- image processing- procedures- Algorithms- Automation- Brain- Cluster Analysis- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

In these applications, clustering algorithms have shown to play an important role in the analysis and visualization of white matter structure, generating useful data which can be the basis for further studies. This work proposes FFClust, an efficient fiber clustering method for large tractography datasets containing millions of fibers. Resulting clusters describe the whole set of main white matter fascicles present on an individual brain. The method aims to identify compact and homogeneous clusters, which enables several applications. In individuals, the clusters can be used to study the local connectivity in pathological brains, while at population level, the processing and analysis of reproducible bundles, and other post-processing algorithms can be carried out to study the brain connectivity and create new white matter bundle atlases. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of quality and execution time performance versus the state-of-the-art clustering techniques used in the area. Results show that FFClust is effective in the creation of compact clusters, with a low intra-cluster distance, while keeping a good quality Davies–Bouldin index, which is a metric that quantifies the quality of clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is about 8.6 times faster than the most efficient state-of-the-art method for one million fibers dataset. In addition, we show that FFClust is able to correctly identify atlas bundles connecting different brain regions, as an example of application and the utility of compact clusters. © 2020 The Author(s);adult- algorithm- article- brain region- controlled study- human- quantitative analysis- tractography- white matter- cluster analysis- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- factual database- image processing- myelinated nerve- nerve cell network- procedures- white matter- Cluster Analysis- Databases, Factual- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Nerve Fibers, Myelinated- Nerve Net- White Matter;English;Article

The connectivity information is obtained from segmented superficial and deep white matter bundles, according to bundle atlases, instead of the whole tractography. Thus, a direct matching between the fiber bundles and the cortical regions is obtained, avoiding the problem of finding the correspondence of the cortical parcels among subjects. Generating parcels from segmented fiber bundles can provide a good representation of the human brain connectome since they are based on bundle atlases that contain the most reproducible short and long connections found on a population of subjects. The method first processes the tractography of each subject and extracts the bundles of the atlas, based on a segmentation algorithm. Next, the intersection between the fiber bundles and the cortical mesh is calculated, to define the initial and final intersection points of each fiber. A fiber filtering is then applied to eliminate misclassified fibers, based on the anatomical definition of each bundle and the labels of Desikan-Killiany anatomical parcellation. A parcellation algorithm is then performed to create a subdivision of the anatomical regions of the cortex, which is reproducible across subjects. This step resolves the overlapping of the fiber bundle extremities over the cortical mesh within each anatomical region. For the analysis, the density of the connections and the degree of overlapping, is considered and represented with a graph. One of our parcellations, an atlas composed of 160 parcels, achieves a reproducibility across subjects of ≈0.74, based on the average Dice's coefficient between subject's connectivity matrices, rather than ≈0.73 obtained for a macro anatomical parcellation of 150 parcels. Moreover, we compared two of our parcellations with state-of-the-art atlases, finding a degree of similarity with dMRI, functional, anatomical, and multi-modal atlases. The higher similarity was found for our parcellation composed of 185 sub-parcels with another parcellation based on dMRI data from the same database, but created with a different approach, leading to 130 parcels in common based on a Dice's coefficient ≥0.5. © Copyright © 2020 López-López, Vázquez, Houenou, Poupon, Mangin, Ladra and Guevara.;adult- article- connectome- controlled study- filtration- human- limb- reproducibility- segmentation algorithm- tractography- white matter- writing;English;Article

The method represents the mesh with a graph and performs a K-means clustering in parallel. It has two modes of use, by default, it performs the geodesic cortical parcellation based on the boundaries of the anatomical parcels provided by the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The other mode performs the complete parcellation of the cortex. Results for both modes and with different values for the total number of sub-parcels show homogeneous sub-parcels. Furthermore, the execution time is 82s for the whole cortex mode and 18s for the Desikan-Killiany atlas subdivision, for a parcellation into 350 sub-parcels. The proposed method will be available to the community to perform the evaluation of data-driven cortical parcellations. As an example, we compared GeoSP parcellation with Desikan-Killiany and Destrieux atlases in 50 subjects, obtaining more homogeneous parcels for GeoSP and minor differences in structural connectivity reproducibility across subjects. © 2020 IEEE.;K-means clustering- Mesh generation- Cortical surfaces- Data driven- Geodesic distances- Parallel method- Reproducibilities- Structural connectivity- Geodesy;English;Conference Paper

The method is able to obtain fiber clusters that are representative of the population. The proposed approach first applies a fast intra-subject clustering algorithm on each subject obtaining the cluster centroids for all subjects. Second, it compresses the collection of centroids to a latent space through the encoder of a trained autoencoder. Finally, it uses a modified HDBSCAN with adjusted parameters on the encoded centroids of all subjects to obtain the final inter-subject clusters. The results shows that the proposed method outperforms other clustering strategies, and it is able to retrieve known fascicles in a reasonable execution time, achieving a precision over 87% and F1 score above 86% on a collection of 20 simulated subjects. © 2020 IEEE.;Cluster analysis- Auto encoders- Cluster centroids- Clustering methods- Clustering strategy- F1 scores- Tractography- Whole brains- Clustering algorithms;English;Conference Paper

Unlike deep white matter (DWM), which has been extensively studied and well documented, superficial white matter (SWM) has been often left aside. Improving our understanding of the SWM is an important goal for a better understanding of the brain network and its relation to several pathologies. The shape and localization of these short bundles present a high variability across subjects. Furthermore, the small diameter of most superficial bundles and partial volume effects induced by their proximity to the cortex leads to complex tratography issues. Therefore, the mapping of SWM bundles and the use of the resulting atlases for clinical studies requiere dedicated methodologies that are reviewed in this paper. © 2020 The Author(s);adult- diffusion weighted imaging- human- partial volume (imaging)- review- tractography- white matter- anatomy and histology- brain- connectome- diffusion tensor imaging- physiology- procedures- white matter- Brain- Connectome- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Humans- White Matter;English;Review

The method consists of five steps, first intra-subject clustering is performed on the brain tractography. The fibers that make up each cluster are then intersected with the cortical mesh and then filtered to discard outliers. In addition, the method resolves the overlapping between the different intersection regions (sub-parcels) through-out the cortex efficiently. Finally, a post-processing is done to achieve more uniform sub-parcels. The output is the complete labeling of cortical mesh vertices, representing the different cortex sub-parcels, with strong connections to other sub-parcels. We evaluated our method with measures of brain connectivity such as functional segregation (clustering coefficient), functional integration (characteristic path length) and small-world. Results in five subjects from ARCHI database show a good individual cortical parcellation for each one, composed of about 200 sub-parcels per hemisphere and complying with these connectivity measures. © 2019 IEEE.;Fibers- Mesh generation- clustering- connectivity- Parcellation- Tractography- White matter- Brain;English;Conference Paper

Widal, Departement de Psychiatrie et de Medecine Additologique, INSERM UMR-S1144, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France;"Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often conceptualized as ""disconnection syndromes,"" with substantial evidence of abnormalities in deep white matter tracts, forming the substrates of long-range connectivity, seen in both disorders. However, the study of superficial white matter (SWM) U-shaped short-range tracts remained challenging until recently, although findings from postmortem studies suggest they are likely integral components of SZ and BD neuropathology. This diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) study aimed to investigate SWM microstructure in vivo in both SZ and BD for the first time. We performed whole brain tractography in 31 people with SZ, 32 people with BD and 54 controls using BrainVISA and Connectomist 2.0. Segmentation and labeling of SWM tracts were performed using a novel, comprehensive U-fiber atlas. Analysis of covariances yielded significant generalized fractional anisotropy (gFA) differences for 17 SWM bundles in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Post hoc analyses showed gFA reductions in both patient groups as compared with controls in bundles connecting regions involved in language processing, mood regulation, working memory, and motor function (pars opercularis, insula, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus). We also found increased gFA in SZ patients in areas overlapping the default mode network (inferior parietal, middle temporal, precuneus), supporting functional hyperconnectivity of this network evidenced in SZ. We thus illustrate that short U-fibers are vulnerable to the pathological processes in major psychiatric illnesses, encouraging improved understanding of their anatomy and function. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.";adolescent- adult- analysis of covariance- anterior cingulate- Article- bipolar disorder- controlled study- correlation analysis- default mode network- diffusion weighted imaging- female- fractional anisotropy- frontal cortex- human- in vivo study- inferior parietal cortex- insula- language processing- major clinical study- male- middle temporal gyrus- mood- motor performance- nerve cell network- nerve fiber- neuroanatomy- neurobiology- neuroimaging- neuropathology- parietal cortex- pars opercularis- post hoc analysis- precuneus- primary motor cortex- priority journal- schizophrenia- statistical analysis- temporal cortex- tractography- white matter- working memory- affect- anisotropy- bipolar disorder- brain cortex- Broca area- case control study- cingulate gyrus- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- frontal lobe- language- middle aged- nerve tract- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- parietal lobe- schizophrenia- short term memory- temporal lobe- white matter- young adult- Adult- Affect- Anisotropy- Bipolar Disorder- Broca Area- Case-Control Studies- Cerebral Cortex- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Female- Frontal Lobe- Gyrus Cinguli- Humans- Language- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male- Memory, Short-Term- Middle Aged- Neural Pathways- Parietal Lobe- Schizophrenia- Temporal Lobe- White Matter- Young Adult;English;Article

This method uses a Diffeomorphic inter-subject alignment procedure including information of cortical foldings and forces the accurate match of the sulci that have to be circumvented by the U-bundles. Then, a clustering is performed to extract the most reproducible bundles across subjects. First results show an increased number of U-bundles consistently mapped in the general population compared with previous atlases created from the same database. Future analysis over this new extended Brain atlas may improve our understanding of the relationship between the folding pattern and the U-bundle variability.

The system is a technological educational application intended to stimulate learning abilities, developed as a native mobile application for devices with Android operating system. It is specially designed for children between 2 and 4 years of age, to stimulate language, contingency and attention, through cognitive tasks in the form of interactive mini-games. The activities teach the association between images with the corresponding infrequently used spoken words, and images of letters with the corresponding sounds (i.e. phonemes). The mini-games are based on multimedia resources, mainly videos of an educator, real objects and animals. The software evaluates progress by measuring interaction parameters such as correct answers and response time and has an algorithm to randomize the trials across children. The application is tested in 314 2-4 year-old children. Each child played a minimum of 8 sessions every other day, each one presenting 6 words and 4 letters, and testing for 3 words and 2 letters. Results showed that ISLACS is an attractive game for young children, which significantly succeeded to teach children the sounds of the letters and a repertory of nearly 48 infrequent words in Spanish, in a brief intervention. © 2019 IEEE.;Engineering- Industrial engineering- Cognitive task- Educational Applications- Interaction parameters- Interactive system- Learning abilities- Mobile applications- Multimedia resources- Young children- Multimedia systems;English;Conference Paper

We implemented a parallel algorithm that improves upon its previous version in both execution time and memory usage. Our new version uses the local memory of each processor, which leads to a reduction in execution time. Hence, it allows the analysis of bigger subject and/or atlas datasets. As a result, the segmentation of a subject of 4,145,000 fibers is reduced from about 14 minutes in the previous version to about 6 minutes, yielding an acceleration of 2.34. In addition, the new algorithm reduces the memory consumption of the previous version by a factor of 0.79. © 2019 IEEE.;Medical imaging- Parallel algorithms- Automatic classification- Bundle atlas- Fiber tractography- Multi core- Optimized algorithms- Parallel optimization- White matter fibers- White matter segmentations- Fibers;English;Conference Paper

A large number of works have focused on long range brain connections, while recently, several studies have also analyzed superficial WM connectivity. In recent years, with the massive use of HCP database, and its processing with known softwares like DSI Studio and MRtrix, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of tractography parameters on the reconstruction of fiber bundles and further analyses. We study the effect of the number of fibers, for whole brain tractography, on the reconstruction of deep and superficial WM bundles based on their segmentation using multi-subject bundle atlases. For DSI Studio (deterministic algorithm), a value of 1M fibers could reconstruct most of deep white matter (DWM) bundles, while a value of 1.5M was required for superficial white matter (SWM) bundles. In the case of MRtrix (probabilistic algorithm), a value of 3M fibers was found to be suitable for the study of both kinds of fibers. Furthermore, we found the tracking of SWM bundles to be more sensitive to several parameters than DWM, for DSI Studio. © 2019 IEEE.;Magnetic resonance imaging- Storm sewers- Studios- Deterministic algorithms- Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging- Fiber bundles- Macroscopic levels- Probabilistic algorithm- Tractography- White matter- Whole brains- Fibers- algorithm- brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- human- image processing- white matter- Algorithms- Brain- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- White Matter;English;Conference Paper

We present a stringent fiber distance measure able to perform a good discrimination between fiber shapes and lengths. It uses three terms: (i) a fiber maximum Euclidean distance, (ii) a fiber shape distance, and (iii) a fiber length distance. The distance was evaluated applying a hierarchical clustering of fibers connecting the pre-and post-central gyri of a subject. Results where compared with other known fiber distance measures. A better sensitivity to differences in fiber shape and length was found for the proposed distance. This will be very useful for the detailed study and description of white matter bundles. Known bundles will be better decomposed into sub-bundles, with more precision on the bundle shape and on the regions connected by the fibers. For short association bundles, this distance will be a real improvement, as even the most stringent distance used until now shows some limitations when evaluating the similarity of these fibers. © 2018 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

In this work, we studied short-distance structural connectivity in a homogeneous population of males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and used a novel methodology specifically suited for assessing U-shaped short-distance tracts, including a recently developed tractography-based atlas of the superficial white matter fibres. We acquired diffusion-weighted MRI for 58 males (27 subjects with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and 31 control subjects) and extracted the mean generalized fractional anisotropy of 63 short-distance tracts. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV), Communication Checklist-Adult, Empathy Quotient, Social Responsiveness Scale and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). In contradiction with the models of short-range overconnectivity in autism spectrum disorder, we found that patients with autism spectrum disorder had a significantly decreased anatomical connectivity in a component comprising 13 short tracts compared to controls. Specific short-tract atypicalities in temporal lobe and insula were significantly associated with clinical manifestations of autism spectrum disorder such as social awareness, language structure, pragmatic skills and empathy, emphasizing their importance in social dysfunction. Short-range decreased anatomical connectivity may thus be an important substrate of social deficits in autism spectrum disorder, in contrast with current models. © The Author(s) (2018).

While long association and projection bundles are stable and have been deeply studied, short association bundles present higher intersubject variability, and few studies have been carried out to adequately describe the structure, shape, and reproducibility of these bundles. However, their analysis is crucial to understand brain function and better characterize the human connectome. In this study, we propose an automatic method to identify reproducible short association bundles of the superficial white matter, based on intersubject hierarchical clustering. The method is applied to the whole brain and finds representative clusters of similar fibers belonging to a group of subjects, according to a distance metric between fibers. We experimented with both affine and non-linear registrations and, due to better reproducibility, chose the results obtained from non-linear registration. Once the clusters are calculated, our method performs automatic labeling of the most stable connections based on individual cortical parcellations. We compare results between two independent groups of subjects from a HARDI database to generate reproducible connections for the creation of an atlas. To perform a better validation of the results, we used a bagging strategy that uses pairs of groups of 27 subjects from a database of 74 subjects. The result is an atlas with 44 bundles in the left hemisphere and 49 in the right hemisphere, of which 33 bundles are found in both hemispheres. Finally, we use the atlas to automatically segment 78 new subjects from a different HARDI database and to analyze stability and lateralization results. © 2017 Román, Guevara, Valenzuela, Figueroa, Houenou, Duclap, Poupon, Mangin and Guevara.;adult- algorithm- Article- brain function- computer model- connectome- corpus callosum- correspondence analysis- data base- female- first cervical vertebra- fractional anisotropy- HARDI database- human- image segmentation- information processing- left hemisphere- male- neuroimaging- normal human- phylogenetic tree- reproducibility- right hemisphere- tractography- white matter- young adult;English;Article

We use a distance metric to compare streamlines in a subject dataset to labeled centroids in the atlas, and label them using a per-bundle configurable threshold. In order to reduce segmentation time, the algorithm first preprocesses the data using a simplified distance metric to rapidly discard candidate streamlines in multiple stages, while guaranteeing that no false negatives are produced. The smaller set of remaining streamlines is then segmented using the original metric, thus eliminating any false positives from the preprocessing stage. As a result, a single-thread implementation of the algorithm can segment a dataset of almost 9 million streamlines in less than 6 minutes. Moreover, parallel versions of our algorithm for multicore processors and graphics processing units further reduce the segmentation time to less than 22 seconds and to 5 seconds, respectively. This performance enables the use of the algorithm in truly interactive applications for visualization, analysis, and segmentation of large white matter tractography datasets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;adult- algorithm- automated pattern recognition- brain- connectome- cytology- diffusion weighted imaging- female- human- image processing- male- nerve tract- procedures- software- white matter- young adult- Adult- Algorithms- Brain- Connectome- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Male- Neural Pathways- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Software- White Matter- Young Adult;English;Article

In particular the study of the superficial white matter (SWM) is an unachieved task. Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of pathogenesis triggered by abnormal connectivity. In this work we automatically created a multi-subject atlas of SWM diffusion-based bundles of the whole brain. For each subject, the complete cortico-cortical tractogram is first split into sub-tractograms connecting pairs of gyri. Then intra-subject shape-based fiber clustering performs compression of each sub-tractogram into a set of bundles. Proceeding further with shape-based clustering provides a match of the bundles across subjects. Bundles found in most of the subjects are instantiated in the atlas. To increase robustness, this procedure was performed with two independent groups of subjects, in order to discard bundles without match across the two independent atlases. Finally, the resulting intersection atlas was projected on a third independent group of subjects in order to filter out bundles without reproducible and reliable projection. The final multi-subject diffusion-based U-fiber atlas is composed of 100 bundles in total, 50 per hemisphere, from which 35 are common to both hemispheres. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;adult- Article- brain cortex- connectome- diffusion tensor imaging- female- hemisphere- human- human experiment- image processing- male- nerve fiber- nerve projection- neuroanatomy- normal human- nuclear magnetic resonance scanner- priority journal- reliability- reproducibility- volunteer- white matter- book- brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion tensor imaging- procedures- standards- white matter- young adult- Adult- Atlases as Topic- Brain- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Male- Reproducibility of Results- White Matter- Young Adult;English;Article

To test this hypothesis, white matter integrity is usually investigated using measures of water diffusivity provided by MRI. Here we consider a more intuitive aspect of the morphometry of the white matter tracts: The shape of the fibre bundles, which is associated with neurodevelopment. We analyzed the shape of 3 tracts involved in BD: The cingulum (CG), uncinate fasciculus (UF) and arcuate fasciculus (AF). Methods: We analyzed diffusion MRI data in patients with BD and healthy controls. The fibre bundles were reconstructed using Q-ball–based tractography and automated segmentation. Using Isomap, a manifold learning method, the differences in the shape of the reconstructed bundles were visualized and quantified. Results: We included 112 patients and 82 controls in our analysis. We found the left AF of patients to be further extended toward the temporal pole, forming a tighter hook than in controls. We found no significant difference in terms of shape for the left UF, the left CG or the 3 right fasciculi. However, in patients compared with controls, the ventrolateral branch of the left UF in the orbitofrontal region had a tendency to be larger, and the left CG of patients had a tendency to be smaller in the frontal lobe and larger in the parietal lobe. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study. Conclusion: Our results suggest neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the left AF in patients with BD. The statistical tendencies observed for the left UF and left CG deserve further study. © 2017 Joule Inc.;adult- arcuate fasciculus- Article- bipolar disorder- cingulum (brain)- comparative study- controlled study- cross-sectional study- diagnostic procedure- diffusion weighted imaging- female- Hamilton Depression Rating Scale- human- major clinical study- male- Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale- national adult reading test- psychosis- shape analysis- tractography- uncinate fasciculus- Young Mania Rating Scale- adolescent- aged- bipolar disorder- brain- clinical trial- diagnostic imaging- image processing- machine learning- middle aged- multicenter study- nerve tract- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Aged- Bipolar Disorder- Brain- Cross-Sectional Studies- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Machine Learning- Male- Middle Aged- Neural Pathways- Young Adult;English;Article

It is hypothesized that CT effects are mediated by the limbic system. Few multimodal neuroimaging studies allow an integrated perspective of this impact. Our goal was thus to study the effects of CT on the limbic network. Methods: We acquired multimodal MRI (T1, diffusion weighted, and resting state fMRI) data from 79 subjects (47 healthy controls and 32 patients with bipolar disorder, BD). We performed correlational analyses between Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (sub)scores (physical and emotional abuse/neglect and sexual abuse) and anatomo-functional measurements of the limbic network (hippocampal and amygdala volumes, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity, uncinate fractional anisotropy). Results: We found CTQ total scores to be negatively correlated with amygdala volume, prefronto-limbic functional connectivity (FC) and uncinate fractional anisotropy in our sample. Considering subscores, neglects (physical and emotional) were the only to affect neural parameters. The patients with BD drove most of the results.

In particular the study of the superficial white matter (SWM) is an unachieved task. Its description is essential for the understanding of human brain function and the study of pathogenesis triggered by abnormal connectivity. In this work we expanded a previously developed method for the automatic creation of a whole brain SWM bundle atlas. The method is based on a hybrid approach. First a cortical parcellation is used to extract fibers connecting two regions. Then an intra-and inter-subject hierarchical clustering are applied to find well-defined SWM bundles reproducible across subjects. In addition to the fronto-parietal and insula regions of the left hemisphere, the analysis was extended to the temporal and occipital lobes, including all their internal regions, for both hemispheres. Validation steps are performed in order to test the robustness of the method and the reproducibility of the obtained bundles. First the method was applied to two independent groups of subjects, in order to discard bundles without match across the two independent atlases. Then, the resulting intersection atlas was projected on a third independent group of subjects in order to filter out bundles without reproducible and reliable projection. The final multi-subject U-fiber atlas is composed of 100 bundles in total, 50 per hemisphere, from which 35 are common to both hemispheres. The atlas can be used in clinical studies for segmentation of the SWM bundles in new subjects, and measure DW values or complement functional data. © 2016 IEEE.;anatomy and histology- brain- brain mapping- cluster analysis- human- procedures- reproducibility- white matter- Brain- Brain Mapping- Cluster Analysis- Humans- Reproducibility of Results- White Matter;English;Conference Paper

We present an automatic method to identify short bundles of the superficial white matter based on inter-subject hierarchical clustering. Our method finds clusters of similar fibers, belonging to the different subjects, according to a distance measure between fibers. First, the algorithm obtains representative bundles and subsequently we perform an automatic labeling based on the anatomy, of the most stable connections. The analysis was applied to two independent groups of 37 subjects. Results between the two groups were compared, in order to keep reproducible connections for the atlas creation. The method was applied using linear and non-linear registration, where the non-linear registration showed significantly better results. A final atlas with 35 bundles in the left hemisphere and 27 in the right hemisphere from the whole brain was obtained. Finally results were validated using the atlas to segment 26 new subjects from another HARDI database. © 2016 IEEE.;algorithm- anatomy and histology- brain- cluster analysis- connectome- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- factual database- human- image processing- procedures- reproducibility- white matter- Algorithms- Brain- Cluster Analysis- Connectome- Databases, Factual- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Reproducibility of Results- White Matter;English;Conference Paper

Their exact relationship is poorly understood, and few studies have directly compared both disorders. Our aim was thus to directly compare neuroanatomy of HFA and SZ using a multimodal MRI design. Methods: We scanned 79 male adult subjects with 3T MRI (23 with HFA, 24 with SZ and 32 healthy controls, with similar non-verbal IQ). We compared them using both diffusion-based whole-brain tractography and T1 voxel-based morphometry. Results: HFA and SZ groups exhibited similar white matter alterations in the left fronto-occipital inferior fasciculus with a decrease in generalized fractional anisotropy compared with controls. In grey matter, the HFA group demonstrated bilateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate increases in contrast with prefrontal and left temporal reductions in SZ. Conclusion: HFA and SZ may share common white matter deficits in long-range connections involved in social functions, but opposite grey matter abnormalities in frontal regions that subserve complex cognitive functions. Our results are consistent with the fronto-occipital underconnectivity theory of HFA and the altered connectivity hypothesis of SZ and suggest the existence of both associated and diametrical liabilities to these two conditions. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Spatial normalization is the variant endowing the atlas with a coordinate system used for voxel-based aggregation of images across subjects and studies. This framework has largely contributed to the success of brain mapping. Brain spatial normalization, however, is still ill-posed because of the complexity of the human brain architecture and the lack of architectural landmarks in standard morphological MRI. Multi-atlas strategies have been developed during the last decade to overcome some difficulties in the context of segmentation. A new generation of registration algorithms embedding architectural features inferred for instance from diffusion or functional MRI is on the verge to improve the architectural value of spatial normalization. A better understanding of the architectural meaning of the cortical folding pattern will lead to use some sulci as complementary constraints. Improving the architectural compliance of spatial normalization may impose to relax the diffeomorphic constraint usually underlying atlas warping. A two-level strategy could be designed: in each region, a dictionary of templates of incompatible folding patterns would be collected and matched in a way or another using rare architectural information, while individual subjects would be aligned using diffeomorphisms to the closest template. Manifold learning could help to aggregate subjects according to their morphology. Connectivity-based strategies could emerge as an alternative to deformation-based alignment leading to match the connectomes of the subjects rather than images. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;algorithm- brain mapping- connectome- delusion- diffusion weighted imaging- Editorial- functional magnetic resonance imaging- human- neuroimaging- priority journal- resting state network- surface area- surface property- algorithm- brain- brain mapping- cytology- diagnostic imaging- image processing- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- procedures- Algorithms- Brain- Brain Mapping- Connectome- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Magnetic Resonance Imaging;English;Editorial

First, various image processing filters are applied to the serial images to automatically sort and stitch them. In a second step, images are aligned, equalized and filtered to generate 3D volumetric image stacks. Finally, within the 3D volume, the neural processes selected by the user are automatically segmented via parallel programming. Thus, the tool renders a model in which pre- and postsynaptic elements become identified in a connectivity matrix. © 2015 IEEE.;Electron microscopy- Medical imaging- Neurons- Parallel programming- Connectivity matrix- connectome- High resolution image- Image processing filters- Image processing tools- Neuronal circuitries- Semi-automatic tools- Volumetric images- Scanning electron microscopy;English;Conference Paper

Our approach exploits expert-provided example data to automatically classify the WM tracts of a subject. Multiple atlases are constructed to model the example data from multiple subjects in order to reflect the individual variability of bundle shapes and trajectories over subjects. For each example subject, an atlas is maintained to allow the example data of a subject to be added or deleted flexibly. A voting scheme is proposed to facilitate the multi-atlas exploitation of example data. For conceptual simplicity, we adopt the same metrics in both example data construction and WM tract labeling. Due to the huge number of WM tracts in a subject, it is time-consuming to label each WM tract individually. Thus, the WM tracts are grouped according to their shape similarity, and WM tracts within each group are labeled simultaneously. To further enhance the computational efficiency, we implemented our approach on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Through nested cross-validation we demonstrated that our approach yielded high classification performance. The average sensitivities for bundles in the left and right hemispheres were 89.5% and 91.0%, respectively, and their average false discovery rates were 14.9% and 14.2%, respectively.

We investigated cortico-striatal connectivity modifications occurring in HD patients using a novel approach which focuses on the projection of the connectivity profile of the basal ganglia onto the cortex. This approach consists in computing, for each subcortical structure, surface connectivity measures representing its strength of connections to the cortex and comparing these measures across groups. In this study, we focused on Huntington disease as an application of this new approach. First, surface cortico-striatal connectivity measures of a group of healthy subjects were averaged in order to infer the ""normal"" connectivity profile of the striatum to the cortex. Second, a statistical analysis was performed from the surface connectivity measures of healthy subjects and HD patients in order to detect the cortical gyri presenting altered cortico-striatal connectivity in HD. Lastly, percentage differences of connectivity between healthy subjects and patients were inferred, for each nucleus of the striatum, from the connectivity measures of the cortical gyri presenting a significant connectivity difference between the two groups. These percentage differences characterize the axonal disruptions between the striatum and the cortex occurring in HD. We found selective region-specific degeneration of cortical connections predominating for associative and primary sensorimotor connections and with relative preservation of limbic connections. Our method can be used to infer novel connectivity-based markers of HD pathological process. © 2013 Marrakchi-Kacem et al.";adult- article- brain degeneration- brain mapping- brain region- clinical article- connectome- controlled study- corpus striatum- cortical gyrus- cortico striatal connectivity- female- human- Huntington chorea- male- nerve fiber degeneration- nerve tract- pathogenesis- sensorimotor function- tractography- brain cortex- brain mapping- diffusion tensor imaging- Huntington chorea- limbic system- middle aged- motor cortex- pathology- procedures- sensory nerve cell- Brain Mapping- Cerebral Cortex- Corpus Striatum- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Female- Humans- Huntington Disease- Limbic System- Male- Middle Aged- Motor Cortex- Sensory Receptor Cells;English;Article

The method is based on a multi-subject bundle atlas derived from a two-level intra-subject and inter-subject clustering strategy. This atlas is a model of the brain white matter organization, computed for a group of subjects, made up of a set of generic fiber bundles that can be detected in most of the population. Each atlas bundle corresponds to several inter-subject clusters manually labeled to account for subdivisions of the underlying pathways often presenting large variability across subjects. An atlas bundle is represented by the multi-subject list of the centroids of all intra-subject clusters in order to get a good sampling of the shape and localization variability. The atlas, composed of 36 known deep white matter bundles and 47 superficial white matter bundles in each hemisphere, was inferred from a first database of 12 brains.

Our method can be seen as a compressing operation, capturing the most meaningful information enclosed in the fiber dataset. For the sake of efficiency, part of the analysis is based on clustering the white matter (WM) voxels rather than the fibers. The resulting regions of interest are used to define subset of fibers that are subdivided further into consistent bundles using a clustering of the fiber extremities. The dataset is reduced from more than one million fiber tracts to about two thousand fiber bundles. Validations are provided using simulated data and a physical phantom. We see our approach as a crucial preprocessing step before further analysis of huge fiber datasets. An important application will be the inference of detailed models of the subdivisions of white matter pathways and the mapping of the main U-fiber bundles. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.;adult- article- child- cluster analysis- data base- human- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- phantom- priority journal- right hemisphere- school child- tractography- visual stimulation- voxel based morphometry- white matter- Adult- Algorithms- Brain- Child- Cluster Analysis- Computer Simulation- Data Compression- Databases, Factual- Diffusion Tensor Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Nerve Fibers- Neural Pathways- Phantoms, Imaging- Reproducibility of Results;English;Article

Furthermore, the frequency droop control is attached in some VSCs to give support in the frequency regulation of the AC grid. Both controllers are theoretically developed, and their interaction exposed. A five terminal MTDC grid is simulated to show the interaction between the AC grids and the HVDC multi-terminal system under two main study cases: Isolated and interconnected AC grids.

Even if there are many random behaviors involved in this subject, the main proposal of this paper is a didactic line of attack for a probabilistic minimal loss reconfiguration problem, that takes into account the randomness of load variations of electric distribution systems. The method is based on the Monte Carlo (MC) technique to assign a random load level in each node of the system. The statistical behavior of the loads is modeled using uniform probability density functions. The model defines a useful stochastic index for medium and long-term operation planning reconfiguration. The optimization problem of reconfiguration is solved using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Principal contributions of this paper are: A) a didactic way to understand a complex electric distribution control theme b) the idea of 'expected or characteristic topologies' controlling the influence of wide random load variations on the system configuration and c) a modal topology (in statistical sense) corresponding to the reconfiguration solution for the average demand values.

This paper proposes a working protocol for the minimization of the average restoration time via the emergency brigades. The methodology involves two stages: (i) discrimination and (ii) tracking of electric faults. The process uses only the principal distribution substation recorded data to construct the ""short-circuit current ranges"" of fault locations (zoning). The tracking is a probabilistic optimization process which uses the failure probability, the inspection time and the transit time of each line (the three basic ideas used by the emergency brigades to locate faults).

These techniques are used to improve understanding of SO2 pollution in the city of Talcahuano (Chile). The results show high SO2 dispersion values, an annual average standard deviation of 63.5 μg m-3 and a Pearson coefficient of variation of 1.59. The asymmetry and kurtosis coefficients (3.1 and 14.3, respectively) confirm the ""non-Gaussianity"" of the SO2 concentrations. The main fluctuations of the data studied are due to seasonal and daily cyclical components. Important annual irregularities are detected by the wavelet analysis of daily cycles, especially in winter. This cyclical component is fundamentally due to meteorological factors (because the zonal industrial emissions, mainly emitted by Oil Refining Plant, are roughly constant). Non-negligible correlations, between SO2 concentration and several meteorological variables (vertical wind, temperature, solar radiation, horizontal wind), were also verified (0.49, 0.40, 0.36 and 0.34, respectively). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 4059, Valparaíso, Chile- Ecole Supérieure d'Electricité, Department of Energy, Gif-sur-Yvette, France- CINVESTAV-IPN, Department of Computer Science, Mexico City, Mexico- University of Concepción, Department of Electrical Engineering, Concepción, Chile;This study proposes and applies an evolutionary-based approach for multiobjective reconfiguration in electrical power distribution networks. In this model, two types of indicators of power quality are minimised: (i) power system's losses and (ii) reliability indices. Four types of reliability indices are considered. A microgenetic algorithm (GA) is used to handle the reconfiguration problem as a multiobjective optimisation problem with competing and non-commensurable objectives. In this context, experiments have been conducted on two standard test systems and a real network. Such problems characterise typical distribution systems taking into consideration several factors associated with the practical operation of medium voltage electrical power networks. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto optimal solutions to the multiobjective reconfiguration problem. In the systems adopted for assessment purposes, our proposed approach was able to find the entire Pareto front. Furthermore, better performance indexes were found in comparison to the Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm 2 (PESA 2) technique, which is another well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithm available in the specialised literature. From a practical point of view, the results established, in general, that a compact trade-off region exists between the power losses and the reliability indices. This means that the proposed approach can recommend to the decision maker a small set of possible solutions in order to select from them the most suitable radial topology. © 2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;Decision makers- Distribution systems- Electrical power- Electrical power networks- Medium voltage- Medium-voltage distribution networks- Micro genetic algorithm- Multi objective- Multi objective evolutionary algorithms- Multiobjective optimisation- Pareto front- Pareto optimal solutions- Performance indices- Possible solutions- Power systems- Power-losses- Radial topology- Real networks- Reconfiguration algorithm- Reconfiguration problems- Reliability Index- Selection algorithm- Standard tests- Distributed parameter networks- Electric network analysis- Electric power supplies to apparatus- Electric power transmission networks- Evolutionary algorithms- Pareto principle- Pumps- Reliability- Multiobjective optimization;English;Article

Renewable energies and the incorporation of operational strategies such as demand-side management have been able to contribute with the aim of facing them. Nonetheless, it is necessary to continue studying demand-side management for water supply systems emphasising it as a strategic tool to make operational decisions. This article presents a methodology based on a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model in order to program the operation of a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant with one pumping station for a desertic remote agricultural zone, in accordance with the principles of demand-side management. A photovoltaic solar plant connected to the grid is considered as a renewable energy source. The mathematical model aims to establish the optimal hourly operating load of the system that minimises the daily margin of purchased electricity costs minus sales income of generated electricity. The case study where the methodology is tested is an agricultural area in Northern Chile.

The sustained increase in the SCCs could exceed the rating of the CBs, dangerously spreading the fault. Several series-connected schemes, such as fault current limiters and series reactors, have been proposed in recent decades to reduce these high currents. This article designs and experimentally verifies the feasibility of a parallel-connected power converter to reduce the SCCs, operating as a controlled current source by absorbing current from the fault point. This new configuration reduces the SCCs in all CBs of an electrical substation. The proposed PFCA is implemented using a single-phase neutral-point clamped (NPC) converter and tested using a predictive current control scheme for short-circuits in a scaled-down power system. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, reducing significantly the first SCC peak, even when the ac bus voltage is close to zero. © 2013 IEEE.;Electric circuit breakers- Power converters- Short circuit currents- Controlled current source- Design and implementations- Electrical substations- Neutral point clamped converters- Parallel connected power converters- Power distribution grids- Power distribution system- Predictive current control- Fault current limiters;English;Article

This paper presents a deadbeat control with the capability to enhance the fast dynamic response, typical of this technique, and therefore to be used for current and voltage control applications that require slower dynamic. The proposed technique is implemented in a three-phase power converter with satisfactory results- moreover, this technique is simple and light in computational cost.

For this, two partial power and two interleaving methods are evaluated in terms of efficiency and performance. The selected topology consists of input-parallel-output-parallel interleaved DC/DC converters, which together with the control strategy, allows a high efficiency photovoltaic system, unlike conventional topologies. However, this type of topology is prone to present an unbalanced power distribution between the DC/DC power cells, mainly due to the natural differences between their components. This paper shows the application of a power balancing control strategy for interleaved partial power converters, which guarantees an equitable power distribution, therefore, it enables a correct sizing of the components.

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, Metropolitan Region, Chile- Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas, Concepción, Bío Bío 4070409, Chile;Given that most of the mines in Chile are situated in regions with high solar resources, solar power could play a significant role as an alternative solution to satisfy the electricity demand in the mining industry. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of integrating solar power technology into copper concentrate plants (CCPs). Three commercial technologies (PV, CSP, and hybrid PV-CSP) are considered for integration into four existing CCPs of different sizes and located in different regions. To provide comprehensive analysis, the design, performance and economic assessment of 12 cases are carried and the investment costs are estimated taking into account characteristics of the Chilean market as well as the effect of scale. The performance analysis reveals a strong influence of the degradation rate on the electricity production of solar power plants. The first-year capacity factor of the CSP units is around 68% while it is around 32% for the case of PV units. Due to the degradation in the performance of the components, the lifetime-averaged capacity factor is about 9% lower than that of the first year. The economic assessment indicates that PV is the most suitable technology for integration into the CCPs. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of PV-CCPs ranges from 35.53 to 44.40 USD/MWhe, depending on the size and the location of the plant. The LCOE for the cases of CSP-CCPs and PV-CSP-CCPs ranges from 127.08 to 168.88 USD/MWhe and from 91.89 to 118.91 USD/MWhe, respectively. The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) of the PV-CCPs ranges from 8 to 9%, it discounted pack-back period (DPP) ranges from 5 to 6 years. The DPP PV-CSP-CCPs ranges from and from 15 to 23 years respectively. Overall, the CSP-CCPs are not atractive investments due to high LCOE, longer DPP, and MIRR. However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that its LCOE could be lowered by reducing the investment costs. For instance, a reduction of about 10% in the LCOE is possible if the specific investment costs of the TES is cut to about 10UDS/kWth. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Copper- Copper metallurgy- Copper smelting- Cost benefit analysis- Cost reduction- Degradation- Earnings- Integration- Investments- Sensitivity analysis- Alternative solutions- Commercial technology- Comprehensive analysis- Concentrating solar power- Electricity production- Internal rate of return- Levelized cost of electricities- Solar power technologies- Solar power plants;English;Article

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, 8370451, Chile- Faculty of Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas 1290, Concepción, Chile;Concerns over the environmental influence of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have encouraged researchers to develop alternative power technologies. Among the most promising, environmentally friendly power technologies for large-scale applications are solar power tower plants. The implementation of this technology calls for practical modeling and simulation tools to both size the plant and investigate the scale effect on its economic indices. This paper proposes a methodology to design the main components of solar power tower plants and to estimate the specific investment costs and the economic indices. The design approach used in this study was successfully validated through a comparison with the design data of two operational commercial power tower plants- namely, Gemasolar (medium-scale plant of 19.9 MWe ) and Crescent Dunes (large-scale plant of 110 MWe ). The average uncertainty in the design of a fully operational power tower plant is 8.75%. A cost estimation showed the strong influence of the size of the plant on the investment costs, as well as on the economic indices, including payback period, internal rate of return, total life charge costs, and levelized cost of electricity. As an illustrative example, the methodology was applied to design six solar power tower plants in the range of 10–100 MWe for integration into mining processes in Chile. The results show that the levelized cost of electricity decreases from 156 USD/MWhe for the case of a 10-MWe plant to 131 USD/MWhe for the case of a 100-MWe plant. The internal rate of return of plants included in the analyses ranges from 0.77% (for the 10-MWe case) to 2.37% (for 100-MWe case). Consequently, the simple payback ranges from 16 years (for the 100-MWe case) to 19 years (for the 10-MWe case). The sensitivity analysis shows that the size of the solar receiver heavily depends on the allowable heat flux. The degradation rate and the discount rate have a strong influence on economic indices. In addition, both the operation and the deprecation period, as well as the price of electricity, have a crucial impact on the viability of a solar power tower plant. The proposed methodology has great potential to provide key information for prospective analyses for the implementation of power tower technologies to satisfy clean energy needs under a wide range of conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Conventional fault current limiters (FCLs) are connected in series with a circuit breaker (CB) that is required to limit the short-circuit current. Instead, the proposed scheme consisted of the parallel connection of a current-controlled power converter to the same bus intended to reduce the amplitude of the short-circuit current. This power converter was controlled to absorb a percentage of the short-circuit current from the bus to reduce the amplitude of the short-circuit current. The proposed active short-circuit current reduction scheme was implemented with a cascaded H-bridge power converter and tested by simulation in a 13.2 kV industrial power distribution system for three-phase faults, showing the effectiveness of the short-circuit current attenuation in reducing the maximum current requirement in all circuit breakers connected to the same bus. The paper also presents the design characteristics of the power converter and its associated control scheme. © 2020 by the authors.;Bridge circuits- Electric circuit breakers- Electric connectors- Electric network analysis- Electric substations- Power control- Power converters- Short circuit currents- Timing circuits- Active reduction- Cascaded H-bridge- Design characteristics- Industrial power distribution systems- Parallel connections- Power distribution system- Power system fault- Three phase faults- Fault current limiters;English;Article

The models are used to predict the clear-sky DNI at a 1-min time resolution. High quality radiometric databases, recorded at PSDA station, located in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are used for this analysis. The models have been arranged into seven sets according to their crucial inputs to identify the impact of each parameter on models’ performance. The results show that turbidity-independent models (sets A, B and C) are not suitable for the modeling of solar direct irradiance. Besides, turbidity-dependent models (sets D, E, F, and G) perform so much better than turbidity-independent models. However, few models perform well under all conditions. Among 11 AOD-dependent models, only six models are considered “good”. The performance of the models of set F decreases with the increase of β (aerosols’ turbidity), while those belonging set G perform adequately even at high turbidity.

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, Metropolitan Region, Chile- Faculty of Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas 1290, Concepción, Bío Bío, Chile;The design and cost estimation of solar thermal systems for integration to industrial processes require the analysis of multiple alternatives in terms of solar collector technology, configurations, and equipment sizes. This paper presents a practical approach to design and to estimate the costs of the integration of solar thermal energy to the mining industry. The approach is applied to integrate a solar thermal system to a copper mining process, which is located in Calama, Chile. The proposed solar thermal system consists of a parabolic trough solar field integrating a thermal energy storage to produce hot air for drying copper concentrate. The analysis indicates a capital cost of 3813 USD/kWth. The most important investments are the solar field (44%) and the energy storage system (42%). The real (nominal) levelized cost of heat is 5.21 (6.03) cent USD/kWth, which is relatively lower than those obtained in Europe. © 2019. The Authors.

The proposed strategy uses the complex representation of the switching states and splits them choosing the best one without using an iterative loop. The resulting algorithm, in terms of the dynamic and static response, performs like the traditional Finite Set Model Predictive Control (FS-MPC). However, the proposed scheme is easy to implement, it does not need to tune parameters nor need a cost function and nor require iterating all the possible states to choose the best. Over the abovementioned advantages, it has the capability to operate the photovoltaic module at the maximum power point (MPP) and the ability to impose a sinusoidal current at the grid side with a unitary displacement power factor. Preliminary results are presented to validate the proposed control method. © 2020 IEEE.;Cost functions- Industrial electronics- Iterative methods- Photovoltaic cells- Predictive control systems- Displacement power factor- Dynamic and static response- Hybrid control scheme- Maximum power point- Photovoltaic applications- Photovoltaic modules- Photovoltaic systems- Sinusoidal currents- Model predictive control;English;Conference Paper

The reliance on fossil fuel and gas generated electricity is a significant proportion of current mining operational costs and the prevalence of diesel fuel usage is a significant health and safety concern. The use of electric vehicles and machinery combined with partial or stand-alone renewable energy powered microgrids provides a pathway to more efficient, sustainable and safer mining operations, both for underground mining and open-pit mining. Electrification also presents an opportunity to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as autonomous vehicles, communications networks and data analysis for safety and higher efficiency. Digitalization and automation is also the solution to reduce operational costs in areas related with concentration and transport. The transition to an electric mining future is complex and will require substantial investment in infrastructure, technologies, and hardware as well as collaboration between the mine operators and service industries, research organisations and regional, State and Federal governments, and newly skilled workforce in Australia. This paper provides an overview of the status of mine electrification and highlights the potential research directions, which aimed to help shape the resource industries transition to an electric and renewables mining future. © 2020 IEEE;Cost reduction- Electric power transmission networks- Electric utilities- Fossil fuels- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)- Internet of things- Investments- Machinery- Microgrids- Service industry- Smart power grids- Underground mine transportation- Communications networks- Federal governments- Internet of Things (IOT)- Potential researches- Renewable energies- Skilled workforces- Substantial investments- Underground mining- Open pit mining;English;Conference Paper

A number of parametric solar radiation models are used backward to estimate the atmospheric turbidity indices. To reduce error propagation, each turbidity index are derived using a specific set of models. Then, an inter-comparison between all the selected models are carried out to establish degree of agreement between the models. High-resolution solar radiation data, at one-minute intervals, taken from Plataforma Solar del Desierto de Atacama, is used in this investigation. Results shows that seven models (among 11 models) generally agree well, with a maximum difference of 0.004 in the estimation of the Angstrom coefficient.

To determine the atmospheric turbidity and solar irradiance, scientists commonly refer to three methods, which are based on ground and/or space instruments. The drawback of these methods is that they do not provide any information about the turbidity of the atmosphere and the intensity of solar irradiance when the instruments are not available. The present study provides an alternative method to quantify the atmospheric turbidity and solar irradiance from measured data of ambient temperature and relative humidity. To overcome the complexity associated with the existing techniques, simple expressions have been proposed to estimate Precipitable Water (PW), Linke's turbidity factor (TL) and aerosols transparency coefficient (k). High quality radiometric databases, recorded at PSDA station, located in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are used to validate the new method. The proposed PW's expression has shown a Mean Bias Error (MBE) of 4.19%, better than the one used in REST2v5 solar radiation code, which has a MBE of 8.06%. Besides, the new method introduced herein, estimates TL with a MBE of 1.31%, which corresponds to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.64% and 10.22% respectively. The method has successively predicted the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) with a high accuracy. Indeed, the average deviation (MBE) from the measured DNI is less than 1%, which corresponds to a MAE and RMSE of 3.29% and 5.21% respectively. The careful analysis of the results reveals strong influence of the atmospheric turbidity's uncertainty on the prediction uncertainty of DNI. © 2019;Aerosols- Energy conservation- Errors- Global warming- Mean square error- Solar energy- Solar radiation- Temperature- Turbidity- Uncertainty analysis- Atacama desert , Chile- Atmospheric turbidity- Direct normal irradiances- Linke's turbidity factor- Prediction uncertainty- Root mean square errors- Solar irradiances- Temperature and relative humidity- Atmospheric humidity;English;Article

This scenario has meant a higher carbon footprint and high energy cost. Mining and mineral processing operations are energy intensive, and therefore, the identification of opportunities for reducing the cost associated with energy is of paramount importance. In this context, the characterization of electrical energy consumptions of the different processes in mining and mineral processing operations is a crucial task towards the development of strategies for increasing energy efficiency and the evaluation of renewable energy sources. This work, based on real data obtained from different Chilean open-pit mining sites, presents the characterization of key electrical energy consumptions for major mining and mineral processing operations.

Its main advantages are its conceptual simplicity, fast control response, flexibility and direct consideration of non linearities as well as constraints. Due to computational constraints, short prediction horizons are usually desired in power converters. However, control issues may appear when applied in topologies that exhibit non-minimum phase behavior such as active front end rectifiers and boost dc-dc converters. This work proposes the use of the concept of statically equivalent outputs in order to control these systems with the shortest prediction horizon. The proposed predictive controller partially inverts the plant dynamics, determining an auxiliary output by means of nonlinear control tools.

Since many mineral processing plants are located in desert regions with high solar radiation levels, companies are looking at solar energy, as a renewable energy source, to supply their energy needs. This work describes two examples of Solar Energy Systems (SES) integration into mineral processing plants. They provide an overview of the current challenges and deliver some lights about opportunities for further developments. The first example describes a hybridization strategy- i.e. a combination of different energy resources, to meet the energy demand of a large water pumping station. The second example illustrates an application where a load shifting strategies is designed to match the cyclic behavior of the energy sources. The main conclusion of this work, is that given the characteristics of solar energy systems and the operation of current mineral processing plants, optimization and control are key enabling techniques to make an efficient use of this renewable energy source.

Under absence of irradiance (clouds and at night) the system keeps the reactive power level into the grid, and the losses of the converter are supplied by the grid. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is capable of injecting a constant and given amount of reactive power during the transitions among the operating modes regardless of the active power level being injected into the grid.

Many mines are located in desert areas, and they need to pump water from isolated wells or from the ocean. Therefore, in order to satisfy the water demand, many high-power water pump stations are required. The operation of these systems is expensive due to the high energy cost. This paper presents a case of study of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system to assist the operation of a water pump station of a mineral processing operation in Chile. An economical analysis is carried out with respect to different design variables and the percentage of the total power required for operating the system in the less favorable conditions (degree of assistance). It is demonstrated that the maximum net present value is obtained for the maximum assistance, i.e., supplying the full energy in the less favorable conditions. However, the internal rate of return will be maximized at the point where the system only supplies the energy to satisfy the full demand at the most favorable conditions. Finally, the study shows that from an economical point of view, PV technology is an attractive alternative to support the mining operation at present time. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Earnings- Mineral industry- Pumps- Solar energy- Solar power generation- Economical analysis- Favorable conditions- Internal rate of return- Mineral processing- Net present value- Power generation economics- Solar photovoltaic system- Technical evaluation- Economic analysis;English;Article

The four control objectives are to self-support the dc-bus voltage under load variations, to compensate the reactive power and the current harmonics, and to balance the dc capacitor voltages by using a predefined combination of the redundant switching states of the converter. The main contribution of the proposed method is that these objectives are accomplished without using weighting factors in the cost function, which eliminates problems such as multiobjective optimization or additional empirical procedures for determination of these factors. As a result, the method is easy to implement and rapidly selects the optimal voltage to improve the dynamic-state performance. Experimental results from a 2-kVA prototype are presented to prove that the method is valid for single-phase compensation. The well-known effect of model parameter errors' issue, which is inherent in predictive control methods, is also tested to confirm that the harmonic distortion in the grid current is below 5% even when the predictive model has a 25% error between actual and theoretically estimated grid impedance values. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Active filters- Cost functions- Electric inverters- Electric power distribution- Harmonic analysis- HVDC power transmission- Model predictive control- Modulation- Multiobjective optimization- Power control- Power converters- Power quality- Predictive control systems- Pulse width modulation- Quality control- Reactive power- Smart power grids- Torque converters- Voltage control- Control design- DC-AC power converters- High voltage techniques- Multi-level systems- Power conversion harmonics- Power distributions- Power harmonic filters- Predictive control- Predictive models- Pulse width modulation converters- Smart grid- Electric power system control;English;Article

Many mines are located in desert areas and they need to pump water from isolated wells or from the ocean. To satisfy the water demand many high power water pump stations are required. The operation of these systems is expensive due to the high-energy cost. This paper presents a case of study of a solar system to assist the operation of a water pump station of a mineral operation in Chile. An economical analysis is carried out with respect to different design variables and the percentage of the total power required for operating the system in the less favorable conditions (degree of assistance). It demonstrates that the maximum net present value is obtained for the maximum assistance, i.e. supplying the full energy in the less favorable conditions. However, the internal rate of return will be maximized at the point where the system only supplies the energy to satisfy the full demand at the most favorable conditions. Finally the study shows that from an economical point of view PV technology is an attractive alternative to support the mining operation at present time. © 2015 IEEE.;Earnings- Economic analysis- Interactive computer systems- Mineral industry- Pumps- Solar energy- Solar power generation- Economical analysis- Favorable conditions- High-energy costs- Internal rate of return- Mining operations- Net present value- Power generation economics- Technical evaluation- Industrial economics;English;Conference Paper

In particular, the trinary one can provide a waveform with 3n levels, where n is the number of cells connected in cascade. Hence, for n = 3, an output voltage with 27 levels can be obtained, ensuring a low total harmonic distortion (THD) and reduced dv/dt. However, when the load consumes active power, some power cells of the inverter can operate in regeneration mode, complicating the topology and control. To overcome this problem, a new modulation method for asymmetric inverters is presented. It features an ac output voltage of 13 levels for n = 3, and ensures unidirectional power flow in every power cell. This new modulation method also provides a voltage waveform with low dv/dt and reduced THD (5.7%). To confirm the approach, power flow and sensitivity analysis to changes in the dc voltage ratios are performed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided. © 2014 IEEE.;Cells- Cytology- Modulation- Topology- Wave filters- DC voltage ratio- DC-AC power converters- DC-link voltages- Multilevel converter- New modulation- Output voltages- Total harmonic distortion (THD)- Voltage waveforms- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

This work shows that it is possible to split the compensation tasks depending on the frequency components present on the line current that is intended to be compensated by using the superposition principle and the modular features of an H-bridge based multilevel STATCOM. This approach allows the implementation of the topology with dedicated modules in order to decouple and simplify the control algorithms. The H-bridge modules can be implemented with two different kinds of semiconductors: (i) slow switches for fundamental frequency compensation modules and (ii) fast switches for harmonic frequency compensation modules. As the modules meant for harmonic cancellation can self-regulate its dc voltage, they can follow the load requirements and thus operate with minimum power. The theoretical analysis is validated in a laboratory prototype. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Algorithms- Electric current regulators- Harmonic analysis- Frequency components- Fundamental frequencies- Harmonic cancellation- Harmonic compensation- Harmonic frequency- Multilevel power converters- Static compensator- Superposition principle- Synchronous machinery;English;Article

For all the three simulated cases the proposed control strategy for the PV plant was always capable to perform the VSG functions (inertial response and damping), even when one of the PV arrays output power went down to 10 %. However, simulation results also showed that in some cases the voltage variations were close to 100 % and even 300 % of its nominal value.

The proposed VSM entails controlling the grid-interface converter of an energy storage system (ESS) to emulate the inertial response and the damping power of a synchronous generator. In addition, self-tuning algorithms are used to continuously search for optimal parameters during the operation of the VSM in order to minimize the amplitude and rate of change of the frequency variations and the power flow through the ESS. The performances of the proposed self-tuning (ST)-VSM and the constant parameters (CP)-VSM were evaluated by comparing their inertial responses and their damping powers for different scenarios of load variations. For the simulated cases, the ST-VSM achieved a similar performance to that of the CP-VSM, while reducing the power flow through the ESS in up to 58%. Moreover, in all the simulated scenarios, the ST-VSM was found to be more efficient than the CP-VSM in attenuating frequency variations, i.e., it used less energy per Hertz reduced. © 2014 IEEE.;Damping- Electric frequency control- Energy storage- Attenuating frequencies- Autonomous power system- Dynamic frequency controls- Energy storage systems- Interface converters- Optimal controls- Self-tuning algorithms- Synchronous machine- Synchronous machinery;English;Article

The four control objectives are: to self-support the dc-bus voltage under load variations, to compensate the reactive power and the current harmonics and to balance the dc capacitor voltages by using a predefined combination of the converter redundant switching states. The key benefit of the proposed method is that these objectives are accomplished without using weighting factors in the cost function which eliminates problems such as multi-objective optimization or additional empirical procedures for determination of these factors. As a result, the method is easy to implement and selects fast the optimal voltage to improve the dynamic-state performance. The well-known effect of model parameter errors issue, which is inherent in predictive control methods, is also tested to confirm that the method is robust even when the predictive model has a 25% error between actual and the theoretically estimated grid impedance values. © 2014 IEEE.;Active filters- Cost functions- Electric current control- Industrial electronics- Model predictive control- Power converters- Predictive control systems- Active power Filter- Converter redundant switching states- Finite control set- Multilevel converter- Neutral point clamped converters- Predictive control- Weighting factors- Multiobjective optimization;English;Conference Paper

MCSCs are built by stacking parallel current source converters. Two advantages that make MCSCs attractive are: (a) extended current/voltage ratings beyond the device ratings and (b) simplicity in balancing the DC link current in each module. This can be accomplished using two optimized modulating patterns that have been proposed for such topologies: (a) multilevel selective harmonic elimination (MSHE) and (b) displaced selective harmonic elimination (DSHE). Both techniques are based on SHE patterns but there are slight differences in their digital implementation due to the way they generate the harmonic cancellation. Furthermore, when these techniques are used in the rectifier stage, it is reported that MSHE and DSHE do not eliminate all the unwanted harmonics due to practical issues such as changes in the modulating indexes to control the DC link currents. This work compares the operation of DSHE and MSHE when used in rectifiers of an MCSC in terms of execution time, robustness to poor sampling frequency, and quality of harmonic profiles on AC input currents under different operating conditions. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical considerations. © 2012 IEEE.;AC drives- Different operating conditions- Digital control- Digital implementation- Harmonic cancellation- Parallel currents- Sampling frequencies- Selective harmonic elimination- AC motors- Digital control systems- Harmonic analysis- Pulse width modulation- Electric rectifiers;English;Article

The proposed current harmonic compensation method is accomplished by injecting a corresponding series voltage distortion at the rectifier ac terminals. The distorted ac voltage generated at the high-power rectifier ac terminal forces the line current to be sinusoidal and increases dc voltage distortion, but it does not affect the EW or ER processes. A complete design procedure for the series active system is presented. In conjunction with simulated results obtained from a 10 c, a 2 kVA laboratory prototype is used to validate the current harmonic compensator scheme. The results obtained through simulation and from the experimental prototype confirm the viability of the proposed compensator and associated control strategy. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;Ac voltage- Active systems- Control strategies- Current harmonic compensation- Current harmonics- Current harmonics compensation- DC voltage- Design procedure- Electrolytic process- Electrorefining- Experimental prototype- High-power- Line currents- Series active filters- Series voltage- Simulated results- Electric distortion- Harmonic analysis- Electric rectifiers;English;Article

The multi-variable, nonlinear, and coupled features of these topologies make the control strategy design a difficult task. Controlling this kind of system with single-variable linear controllers-as proposed in this work-presents significant advantages compared with other approaches as simplicity in the design steps due to the large amount of tools developed for this kind of schemes. Particularly, a classic design method based on the root locus approach is used to choose the controllers parameters in order to achieve a given dynamical behavior. Compensation of reactive power and fundamental frequency disturbances is presented in this paper as part of a general control strategy for multilevel active power filters. The proposed control strategy is implemented on the TMS320C6713 DSP-based system for a low-power laboratory prototype, and thus the controllers design is carried out on the discrete-time and -frequency domain. Also, due to the inherent asymmetries among the power cells in a modular topology, a dedicated local control strategy is proposed to ensure a symmetrical distribution of the power among the power cells. This feature allows the semiconductor devices of each module to operate under the same voltage and current ratings. Simulated and experimental results showing stationary and transient conditions demonstrate the feasibility of the control scheme. © 2012 IEEE.;Controllers- Design- Discrete time control systems- Frequency domain analysis- Linear control systems- Power quality- Root loci- Semiconductor devices- Topology- Active power Filter- Dynamical behaviors- Fundamental frequencies- Linear controls- Local control strategies- Multilevel power converters- Transient conditions- Unified power quality conditioners- Quality control;English;Article

In this work, a control scheme is proposed in order to compensate the oscillating power, avoiding to oversize the DC reactor at the expense of increasing the distortion of the input currents in each power cell and the instantaneous peak of the modulation index. However, the overall input currents present very low distortion and the instantaneous peak of the modulation index can be reduced by properly designing the multi-pulse transformer in terms of voltage ratio and phase shift. Both, the input currents distortion and the effect in the modulation index are mathematically characterized. Simulation result illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. © 2012 IEEE.;Control approach- Control schemes- Current source converters- Dc current- DC links- DC reactor- Improved control scheme- Input current- Low distortion- Multicell- Multipulses- Non linear control- On currents- Power cells- Single-phase inverters- Voltage ratios- Cytology- Industrial electronics- Linear control systems- Modulation- Pulse transformers- Topology- Cells;English;Conference Paper

Current sub- and inter-harmonics affect the operation of power transformers, causing a reduction in the system efficiency and power quality. Inter-harmonics can be very evident in converters with single-phase stages, as they require large capacitors to filter out the voltage and current second harmonic present in the DC links, which usually is not fully mitigated. This is the case of the cascade multilevel converter based on single-phase power cells, where each power cell has a single-phase rectifier and a single-phase inverter that become not totally decoupled with standard size capacitors. This paper shows that it is possible to improve the quality of the input currents of such power cells even when the input/output frequencies are different. This is achieved by means of magnetic couplings among the DC links of the power cells that feed different output phases. © 2011 IEEE.;AC/DC/AC converter- Cascade multilevel converter- DC links- DC-link filters- Improving power- Input current- Input/output- Inter-harmonics- Line currents- Non-regenerative- Operating frequency- Power cells- Second harmonics- Single-phase inverters- Single-phase power- Single-phase rectifiers- Standard size- Subharmonics- System efficiency- Cells- DC power transmission- Electric converters- Harmonic analysis- Industrial electronics- Magnetic couplings- Paper capacitors- Power quality- Power transformers- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

Differently to configurations based on symmetrical units, the proposed structure is assembled using one type of power cells for compensating reactive power at fundamental frequency and another kind of power cells for compensating harmonic currents. Hence, high power - slow semiconductors can be used in power cells to compensate reactive power at fundamental frequency using low switching frequencies and the harmonic compensation is done using power cells that feature low power - faster semiconductors commutated at high frequencies. Thus, the functionality and overall efficiency can be improved while keeping the modularity feature. Moreover, this approach allows decoupling the control objectives and thus, using the superposition principle, independent control strategies can be designed. Additionally, the power cells considered for harmonic compensation can be self adjusted as the load conditions change in order to operate at minimal DC voltage.

The controller is now able to make all required tasks for the correct operation of the APF, such as current-harmonic elimination and removal of high-frequency noise. The low switching-frequency operation of the nine-level converter was an important advantage in the application of the industrial controller. In addition, with the nine-level filter, switching losses were significantly reduced. The filter was designed to work as voltage source and operates as harmonic isolator, improving the filtering characteristics of the passive filter. The control strategy for detecting current harmonics is based on the $p{-}q$ theory and the phase-tracking system in a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop. The dc-link voltage control is analyzed together with the effect of controller gain and delay time in the system's stability.

The procedure is based on the fact that the load and distributor operating conditions range are known and it is required to impose stiff operating conditions in both the load side (regulation) and the point of common coupling side (power factor). Due to the arbitrary number of cells to be used in a modular approach, the proposed design procedure allows to select the power semiconductors and capacitors based on an economical evaluation, so an optimal number of cells can be chosen to minimize the overall power cell cost. This design procedure is well suited for modular configurations, where several degrees of freedom are not covered if just technical criteria are followed. Thus, an economic approach can be used to select the appropriate components.

Particularly, if the topology is used in systems that are connected to an unbalanced AC network and/or feeds an unbalanced load. The topology in combination with the proposed arrange of the power cells and the multi-pulse transformer becomes best suitable for applications where the quality of the voltage and current waveforms are of main concern. In fact, the topology minimizes the problems produced by unbalanced loads even though the single-phase nature of both the input and output of the power cells. Moreover, the proposed arrange acts as a buffer for the AC mains voltage unbalances as they do not have any effect on the load voltages. The paper includes the comparison between a reported alternative to arrange the cells with the proposed approach. Particularly, the voltages and currents are shown for both an unbalanced AC mains and an unbalanced load. Unbalance and distortion factors are included to quantify the advantages of the proposed arrange. ©2008 IEEE.;Cells- Cytology- Distributed power generation- Electric transformers- Power electronics- Pulse transformers- Topology- Ac networks- Current waveforms- Input and output- Load voltages- Multi-pulse- Output powers- Overall performance- Power cells- Unbalanced loads- Unbalanced systems- Voltage unbalances- Voltage wave forms- Power quality;English;Conference Paper

The proposed passive filter topology has the advantage of simultaneously attenuating high frequency leakage currents generated by common mode voltages and reducing the amplitude of the over-voltage at motor terminals due to wave reflection. The proposed passive filter takes advantage of a dual R-C configuration and can be implemented either in PWM inverters or active front end rectifiers. It is shown that the proposed topology is of simple implementation and shows very good performance for attenuation of both common mode leakage currents and over-voltage.

Differently to topologies based on symmetrical units, the proposed topology is assembled using one type of single-phase power cells for compensating disturbances at the fundamental frequency and another type for compensating harmonic currents. This feature allows the implementation of the power cells with different types of semiconductors, so the cells that compensate at the fundamental frequency can use slower semiconductors but with higher voltage/current ratings and the power cells that compensate harmonics can use faster semiconductors but with lower voltage/current ratings. In addition, as the control objectives of the two types of cells are different, two control schemes are designed to operate independently. Particularly, power cells for harmonic compensation can dynamically adjust its own DC voltage to follow the load conditions in order to operate with maximum efficiency. Simulated preliminary results confirm the theoretical considerations. © 2008 IEEE.;Crystals- Electric conductivity- Harmonic analysis- Industrial electronics- Natural frequencies- Semiconductor materials- Control objectives- Control schemes- Dc voltages- Fundamental frequencies- Harmonic cancellations- Harmonic compensations- Harmonic currents- Load conditions- Maximum efficiencies- Modular approaches- Multi cells- Power cells- Single-phase power- Unified power quality conditioners- Cells;English;Conference Paper

The topology is mainly the dual of the conventional topology based on voltage-source power cells. As such, it inherits all the advantages of the standard topology. But more importantly, the second current harmonic injected back by the normal operation of the single-phase current-source inverters are naturally cancelled out at the DC side of the power cells. This feature is assured by sharing the same magnetic circuit among the inverters connected to different load phases. As a result, the DC link filter required by the operation of the cell needs to be designed just to filter out the switching harmonics. Differently to voltage-source power cells based N-level converters, this ensures a small filter size, an important feature for medium to high power applications. Moreover, standard modulating techniques can be used such as SPWM, space vector"" and Selective Harmonic Elimination without any penalties on the aforementioned advantages.

The proposed algorithm includes a multiplier, a filter, a feedback closed loop, and a numerically controlled oscillator stage. As a result, a discrete sine (and cosine) signal is generated in synchronism with the fundamental component of an external-reference (ER) signal. Moreover, the sampling period of the algorithm is adjusted at each sampling instant such that an integer number of sampling periods per period of the ER signal is ensured. This is the main feature, and it is achieved by using a discrete rectangular window filter and a discrete controller. The proposed algorithm code is simple, stable, and presents high noise rejection.

Standard low power ASDs are based on a rectifier, a voltage DC link, and an inverter. The selection of an ASD depends upon the voltage and power rating of the load. For low power levels there are standard topologies that use standard semiconductors and thus with high availability and low cost. However, for high power rating, the ASD is mostly a more sophisticated power topology. Recent approaches include NPC, multi-cell, and H-bridge base topologies. This work proposes to stack standard low power ASDs to achieve higher operating power levels.

Linear and nonlinear control schemes are compared in terms of system modeling, dynamic response, signal tracking, stability, and implementation. Mathematical, analytical, and practical simulation results demonstrate that nonlinear control allows a better compensation performance under transient and steady state operating conditions. The implemented nonlinear scheme is a passivity based control (PBC), whereas the linear control is implemented with the traditional PI. This paper validates that the passivity based nonlinear control is a better and feasible alternative for converter applications, especially when fast dynamic response, zero steady state error, changes of operating points, no overshoots on the controlled signal, and an easy implementation are required.

The work identifies the causes for the phenomena and proposes a control strategy to mitigate it. The strategy is conceived for carrier-based modulating techniques. Specifically, the middle point of the carriers is used to produce a zero current sequence that is used to balance the DC link voltages. An interesting outcome is the mathematical justification for using either the series or the parallel converter to control the unbalance as a function of the operating point of the system. As a result, the UPQC can keep the load voltage and PCC power factor while the DC link voltage unbalance is minimized even during transient conditions at both the PCC voltage level and load level.

The shortcoming of this topology is that the H bridges are not interchangeable and then, under certain faulty conditions, the converter cannot operate. A reconfiguration system based on bi-directional electronic valves has been designed for a 3-phase cascaded H-bridges. Once a fault is detected in any of the IGBTs of any H-bridge, the control is capable to reconfigure the hardware at the faulty phase by means of eliminating the damaged bridge. If the faulty bridge is not the smallest one, then the bi-directional-valve system reconfigure the faulty phase to keep the higher power bridges in operation. In this way, that phase can continue working at the same voltage level by adjusting its gating signals.

Many levels or steps can follow a voltage reference with accuracy, and with the advantage that the generated voltage can be modulated in amplitude instead of pulse-width modulation. The main disadvantage of this type of topology is the large number of power supplies and semiconductors required to obtain these multistep voltage waveforms. This paper is focussed on minimizing the number of power supplies and semiconductors for a given number of levels. Different combinations of topologies are presented, and the corresponding mathematical relations have been derived.

Each phase of the converter is composed of four three-state converters, all of them connected to the same capacitor dc link voltage and their output connected in series through output transformers. The main advantages of this kind of converter are the negligible harmonic distortion obtained and the very low switching frequency operation. The single-phase equivalent circuit is analyzed and their governing equations derived. The dc link voltage control, based on manipulating the converter's voltage phase, is analyzed together with the circuit's characteristics that determine the capability to draw or deliver active and reactive current. Simulation results for this application are compared with conventional pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters, showing that this filter can compensate load current harmonics, keeping better-quality sinusoidal currents from the source. The simulated configuration uses a 1-F ultracapacitor in the dc link, making it possible to store energy and deliver it during short voltage dips. This is achieved by applying a modulation control to maintain a stable ac voltage during dc voltage drops.

Conventionally, due to power level and simplicity, the topology of choice for implementing microinverters is cascading a flyback type DC-DC converter with a single-phase voltage source inverter. This solution, however, has drawbacks such as a highly discontinuous input current, and the presence of a large second harmonic component in the current drawn from the module. Both disadvantages have the effect of difficulting following the maximum power point of the module and reducing overall performance of the system. To mitigate these issues, in this paper a double boost microinverter topology is presented. The proposed microinverter is implemented by cascading a phase-shifted coupled inductor dual boost DC-DC converter with a single-phase voltage source inverter. Operation of the microinverter is presented and analyzed in this paper. Finally, it is shown through computer simulations that the proposed structure effectively interfaces the PV module to the grid, drawing a mostly DC current with reduced second harmonic ripple, thus showing improved performance. © 2022 IEEE.;Boost converter- Electric inverters- Solar panels- 'current- Generation market- Micro inverters- Microinverter- Performance- Phase voltage source inverters- PV- PV generation- Reduced ripple DC-DC converter- Single phasis- Topology;English;Conference Paper

However, since microinverters are essentially single-phase converters, a large second harmonic current component is drawn from the PV module, thus difficulting following its maximum power point, impacting power generation capability and overall efficiency of the system. To tackle these issues, a modified single-stage quasi-Z-source microinverter topology is presented, in which the qZS impedance network is modified by magnetically coupling its inductors. It is shown through analysis and simulations that this modification has the effect of blocking most low-frequency components from the current drawn from the PV module, making it almost DC. This along with its single-stage construction, high voltage gain, and reduced component count results in a high-performance solution. © 2022 IEEE.;Electric power transmission networks- Energy harvesting- HVDC power transmission- Power converters- Input current ripple- Micro inverters- Microinverter- Power conversion- PV- PV modules- Quasi-Z source converter- Single phase converter- Single stage- Z-Source- Solar panels;English;Conference Paper

Moreover, microinverters which are essentially modular, allow the system to grow over time and result in a more reliable solar plant. In the implementation of a microinverter system important features are its overall voltage gain, to allow interfacing the low voltage PV module to the grid and its power conversion efficiency. The traditional approach to achieve these two aspects is to use a two-stage system where a fly-back converter is cascaded with a single-phase inverter, which has drawbacks such as a discontinuous input current with high second harmonic ripple, high EM noise, high semiconductor stress, and reduced efficiency. In this paper, a single-stage quasi-Z source push-pull matrix microinverter system is presented to deal with some of these drawbacks. Resulting in a high-performance microinverter topology which produces the required voltage gain, while having continuous input current and a high-quality output. © 2020 IEEE.;Conversion efficiency- Gain measurement- Photovoltaic cells- Power electronics- Flyback converters- Grid-connected PV- Important features- Power conditioning- Power conversion efficiencies- Second harmonics- Single-phase inverters- Traditional approaches- Electric power transmission networks;English;Conference Paper

This since the PV source is characterized by having a soft response, i.e. its voltage has a large variation between open circuit and maximum power point, and by having low magnitude. Moreover, power generated varies with solar irradiance and due to shadows. Thus, the DC-DC converter in the power conditioner has to provide a large voltage gain and must be able of following the maximum power point of the source as the irradiance varies. Also, it is highly desirable that the current drawn from the source should be continuous, and with as little ripple as possible to optimize energy harvesting. Over the years, several DC-DC topologies that can comply with these requirements have been proposed and tested. Among these, two appear as good candidates due to their performance in terms of voltage gain and input current regulation, the quasi-Y source, and the quasi-Z source converters. In this paper analysis and comparison of these two topologies is performed and it is shown that the latter offers better operation characteristics in terms of performance and power density. © 2020 IEEE.;Energy harvesting- Gain measurement- Photovoltaic cells- Power electronics- Solar power generation- Solar power plants- Topology- Maximum power point- Operation characteristic- Paper analysis- Power conditioners- Power densities- Pv applications- Quasi-z-source converters- Solar irradiances- DC-DC converters;English;Conference Paper

In addition, the use of microinverters results in a modular system which can grow over time, with increased reliability. Key aspects for the implementation of a microinverter are that the selected power converter topology is required to have high voltage gain to interface the low voltage PV input to the grid, and to have high efficiency. Usually, microinverters are implemented in a two-stage approach which impacts overall power conversion efficiency. Further, a fly-back converter is commonly used as input stage, which has several disadvantages such as high EM noise, high semiconductor voltage stress, and that a highly discontinuous current is drawn from the PV module.

This mainly due to the high solar irradiation levels available and governmental backing of the technology. However, this growth is predominantly due to large-scale utility size power plants, being distributed generation on residential and commercial installations only a small fraction of it. This reduced growth on small scale PV systems is primarily attributed to the lack of qualified designers and installers, and the low awareness among the general public on the benefits of solar generation. To help tackle this problem, the development of an integrated e-learning platform is under way, which will provide differentiated courses for each objective group.

This means they do not have inertia as rotating machines do, and thus, they cannot handle transient load demands that go over their instantaneous maximum power point. In addition, when compared to traditional generators their power ramp rate is much steeper, being able to reach values of 90% per minute and higher. Both characteristics have an impact on power system operation, especially in the case of large PV plants. For example, due to their lack of inertia, a PV plant cannot participate in primary frequency regulation, injecting active power during system faults. Further, the rapid power ramp rate exhibit by PV plants can also affect system stability due to the fast increase or decrease in generated power, which usually cannot be compensated by the rest of the generators in the grid. In this regard, it has been shown that these two issues can be mitigated by the addition of energy storage elements to the PV plant power conditioning system. However, to do so proper sizing, interfacing and control of the energy storage is required. To tackle this issue, analysis of energy storage requirements for a grid connected power plant is performed in this paper. As a result, sizing guidelines and a design procedure for the required battery bank are developed. In addition, a control strategy to regulate the power ramp rate of the system is presented and its effectiveness verified through computer simulations. © 2018 IEEE.;Computer control systems- Design- Energy storage- Power electronics- Ramp generators- Silicon compounds- System stability- Grid-connected PV power plants- Maximum power point- Photovoltalcs- Power conditioning systems- Power ramp rates- Power system operations- Primary frequency regulation- Storage requirements- Electric power transmission networks;English;Conference Paper

These curves are function of instantaneous solar irradiation and cell temperature- and outline the maximum power that the system can supply at any given moment. As a consequence of this PV systems lack overload capacity, which is common in traditional rotating generators- and therefore, PV systems cannot supply short term or transient load demands. To solve this issue two approaches can be taken- one is to constantly operate the PV system below its maximum power level, which has the drawback of non-optimal energy harvesting. The other is integration of energy storage elements to the power conditioning system, which allows optimizing power generation, while adding overload capacity. In addition, this approach also allows smoothing out short term irradiation variations allowing the system to improve energy harvesting. Focusing on the second approach analysis of short term energy storage requirements in PV systems is performed in this paper. As a result, sizing guidelines and a design procedure for a supercapacitor based energy storage system are developed. In addition, effectiveness of the proposed method on improving PV generator performance is tested and verified through computer simulations. © 2017 IEEE.;Design- Electric generators- Energy harvesting- Energy resources- Irradiation- Renewable energy resources- Supercapacitor- Energy storage systems- Overload capacity- Photovoltaics- Power conditioning systems- Short term- Solar irradiation- Storage elements- Storage requirements- Energy storage;English;Conference Paper

In addition, PV panels do not have overload capability and therefore they cannot supply power above their maximum power points during load transients. To solve these issues the use of energy buffer elements such as Supercapacitors has been proposed, which can provide energy to ride through short term generation reduction due to passing clouds or panel shading and can release energy during load transients, thus improving panel characteristics. In this paper analysis of different possible connection points of Supercapacitor banks to a power conditioning system for PV applications has been done.

This is mainly due to their high energy conversion efficiency and simple operation. Since the output of the fuel cell is low voltage DC, fuel cell systems supplying power to AC loads are usually constructed using a two stage approach cascading a DC-DC converter and an inverter. It can be shown that in such a system the current drawn from the fuel cell under normal single phase (or unbalanced three phase) operation contains a large second harmonic component. Due to the internal impedance of the fuel cell stack the presence of low frequency current ripple has as side effect additional heating, and more importantly, a reduction in its output power thus diminishing the power availability and power conversion efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem an auxiliary power converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter operates as an active filter supplying the low frequency ripple current demanded by the power converter allowing the fuel cell stack to supply the DC component, which in turn optimizes system operation. In addition the proposed converter, if suited with an energy storage element such as a supercapacitor, can be controlled to supply transient load changes further improving stack characteristics. © 2010 IEEE.;AC load- Active power Filter- Additional heating- Auxiliary power- DC components- Fuel cell application- Fuel cell stack- Fuel cell system- High energy- Internal impedance- Low frequency- Low voltages- Low-frequency currents- Output power- Power conditioning- Power conversion efficiencies- Ripple currents- Second harmonic component- Side effect- Simple operation- Single phase- Storage Elements- Super capacitor- System operation- Three phase- Transient load- Two stage approach- Active filters- Conversion efficiency- Energy conversion- Fuel systems- Power converters- Power electronics- Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)- DC power transmission;English;Conference Paper

The output voltage of each fuel cell is about 0.4 V at full-load, and several of them are connected in series to construct a stack. An example 100 V fuel cell stack consists of 250 cells in series and to produce 300 V at full-load requires 750 cells stacked in series. Since fuel cells actively convert the supplied fuel to electricity, each cell requires proper distribution of fuel, humidification, coupled with water/thermal management needs. With this added complexity, stacking more cells in series decreases the reliability of the system. For example, in the presence of bad or malperforming cell/cells in a stack, uneven heating coupled with variations in cell voltages may occur. Continuous operation under these conditions may not be possible or the overall stack output power is severely limited. In this paper, a modular fuel cell powered by a modular dc-dc converter is proposed. The proposed concept electrically divides the fuel cell stack into various sections, each powered by a dc-dc converter. The proposed modular fuel cell powered by modular dc-dc converter eliminates many of these disadvantages, resulting in a fault tolerant system. A design example is presented for a 150-W, three-section fuel cell stack and dc-dc converter topology.

It is customary for a utility-scale fuel cell stack to consist of several hundreds of series-connected cells, each producing 0.6 V at full load. A power conditioner consisting of dc-dc and dc-ac converters is required for utility interface, which are operated in high frequency, employing pulsewidth-modulation control for voltage and current regulation. Due to their switch-mode nature, a common-mode voltage with respect to ground is generated. The common-mode voltage, in turn, contributes to the circulating ground current, which can interfere with the ground fault protection system. In addition, it also contributes to the neutral shift and electromagnetic interference. Moreover, the electrostatic potential to ground within the fuel cell stack needs to be limited for safe operation. This paper presents an analysis of common-mode voltage in several fuel-cell-powered converter topologies connected to the electric utility and discusses several mitigation methods suitable for utility-scale generation. © 2008 IEEE.;Electric grounding- Electric inverters- Electric utilities- Electrochemistry- Electromagnetic compatibility- Electromagnetic pulse- Soil conditioners- Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)- Common-mode current- Common-mode voltage- Converter topologies- Current regulations- DC-AC converters- Electro magnetic interferences- Electrostatic potentials- Fuel cell power conditioners- Fuel cell stacks- Fuel-cell- Full loads- Ground currents- Ground-fault protections- High frequencies- Mitigation methods- Neutral shifts- No loads- Power conditioners- Pulse-width-modulation- Safe operations- Utility interactive- Utility interfaces- Voltage variations- Cells;English;Article

This poses a serious problem to the operation of PEM fuel cell stacks reducing its active area due to poisoning- and thus its terminal voltage and output power. This paper presents a cost effective solution for the CO poisoning problem, based on a low cost, reduced power rating converter. It is shown that the proposed system allows the operation of the stack with contaminated fuel for extended periods of time with minimal output power degradation. Additionally the proposed system has the advantage of being an add-on solution that can be connected to existing power conditioner units, being rated only for 10% of the nominal power of the main converter. ©2008 IEEE.;Carbon monoxide- Concentration (process)- Cost effectiveness- Direct energy conversion- Electric batteries- Electric power systems- Electrochemistry- Fuel cells- Fuels- Gas fuels- Gas industry- Hydrogen- Hydrogen fuels- Nonmetals- Power electronics- Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)- Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)- Sulfate minerals- Active areas- CO poisoning- CO-tolerance- Cost-effective solutions- Fuel cell systems- H igh concentrations- Low costs- Output power degradation- Output powers- PEM fuel cells- Power conditioners- Power ratings- Start Ups- Terminal voltages- Energy conservation;English;Conference Paper

As a consequence the overall output power of the system is reduced. Moreover continuous operation under these conditions may not be possible due to excessive heat generation in underperforming cells. In this paper a modular fuel cell powered by a modular DC-DC converter is proposed. This approach electrically divides the fuel cell stack into various sections, each powered by a DC-DC converter, allowing loading each section in the stack according to its state. That is better performing sections handle more load than underperforming sections while the output voltage of the system is kept regulated. In addition the proposed approach can bypass malfunctioning sections while the rest of the stack can continue operation, thus improving the reliability of the system.

A commercially available Ballard Nexa (43-26V, 1.2kW) PEMFC fuel cell along with suitable DC/DC and DC/AC power electronic converter modules is employed. The proposed topology provides stable power to the load when the utility is interrupted. The design considerations include: obtaining an electrical equivalent circuit for fuel cell to facilitate the mathematical analysis of interactions between the fuel cell internal impedance and DC/DC converter. The analysis presented provides a design methodology to check for steady state and transient stability of fuel cell and DC/DC converter interaction in closed loop control to regulate the output DC voltage. For this example system it is shown that the fuel cell's dominant time constant is load dependent and varies from 8.97ms (light load) to 20.37ms (full load) resulting in fuel cells relatively slow dynamic response. Design inequalities are reviewed to better understand the interaction between the DC/DC converter, fuel cell and potential instability conditions. Finally, a supercapacitor module is incorporated to overcome the electrical transients such as instantaneous power fluctuations, slow dynamics of the fuel processor and overload conditions. Energy stored in the supercapacitor is also utilized to handle a momentary overload for a short duration. It is shown that the supercapacitor value calculated for overload conditions are sufficient to enhance stability and improve dynamics respond of the fuel cell. Due to the absence of batteries the system satisfies the demand for an environmentally friendly clean source of energy. A complete design example illustrating the amount of hydrogen storage required for 1 hour power outage and sizing of supercapacitors for transient load demand is presented for a 1.5kVA UPS. ©2008 IEEE.;Closed-loop controls- Dc/dc converters- Design considerations- Design methodologies- Electrical equivalent circuit- Electrical transients- Environmentally-friendly- Fuel processors- Full loads- Instantaneous power- Internal impedance- Light loads- Mathematical analyses- Output DC voltage- Overload conditions- Potential instability- Power outages- Power-electronic converters- Slow dynamics- Source of energy- Steady states- Super capacitors- Time constants- Transient loads- Transient stability- Capacitors- Cells- Closed loop control systems- Cytology- Direct energy conversion- Dynamic response- Dynamics- Electric batteries- Electric power systems- Electrochemistry- Energy storage- Exhibitions- Flow interactions- Fuel cells- Hydrogen- Hydrogen storage- Nonmetals- Power electronics- Power supply circuits- Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)- System stability- Ultraviolet spectroscopy- Uninterruptible power systems- Fuels;English;Conference Paper

First, the electric equivalent circuit model of the fuel cell and the supercapacitor is obtained using frequency analysis, which is essential in establishing a design procedure to size the required supercapacitor. It is evident from the nonlinear model of the supercapacitor that the capacitance increases with voltage. Since the fuel cell voltage is inversely proportional to the output power supplied, it is shown that combining fuel cell with supercapacitor is particularly advantageous to guard against load transients as higher energy is stored while supplying lighter loads. The other advantages of connecting the supercapacitor in parallel with the fuel cell are shown to be: (a) increased steady state stability when powering constant power loads, (b) voltage and system performance stability during fuel cell dynamics (purging), and (c) increased fuel efficiency (i.e. reduced hydrogen consumption). For transient stability analysis, the effect of fuel cell internal impedance (extra element), along with the impedance of the nonlinear supercapacitor, on the transfer function of the DC/DC converter is analyzed. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparison of fuel consumption in the conventional and hybrid systems is performed, showing that the hybrid source has improved fuel utilization. From these results, it is shown that the proposed approach permits optimization of energy management and improvement of dynamic performance of the power conditioner. The experimental results obtained on 20 W and 30 W PEM fuel cell/boost converter systems demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. ©2008 IEEE.;Constant power loads- Dc/dc converters- Design procedures- Dynamic performances- Equivalent circuit model- Experimental evaluations- Frequency analysis- Fuel cell voltage- Fuel efficiency- Fuel utilization- Fuel-cell dynamics- Hybrid source- Hybrid Systems- Hydrogen consumption- Internal impedance- Load transients- Non-linear modeling- Output powers- Portable applications- Power conditioners- Steady-state stability- Super capacitors- System performances- Transient stability analysis- Capacitors- Cells- Conservation- Cytology- Direct energy conversion- Electric batteries- Electric load forecasting- Electrochemistry- Energy conservation- Fuel cells- Hydrogen- Nonmetals- Optical bistability- Power electronics- Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)- System stability- Transfer functions- Fuels;English;Conference Paper

The output voltage of each fuel cell is about 0.4V at full load and several of them are connected in series to construct a stack. An example 100V fuel cell stack consists of 250 cells in series and to produce 300V at full load requires 750 cells stacked in series. Since fuel cells actively convert the supplied fuel to electricity, each cell requires proper distribution of fuel, humidification, coupled with water/thermal management needs. With this added complexity stacking more cells in series decreases the reliability of the system. For example, in the presence of bad or mal-performing cell/cells in a stack, uneven heating coupled with variations in cell voltages may occur. Continuous operation under these conditions may not be possible or the overall stack output power is severely limited. In this paper a modular fuel cell powered by a modular DC-DC converter is proposed. The proposed concept electrically divides the fuel cell stack into various sections, each powered by a DC-DC converter. The proposed modular fuel cell powered by modular DC-DC converter eliminates many of these disadvantages, resulting in a fault tolerant system. A design example is presented for a 150W, three section fuel cell stack and DC-DC converter topology.

In micro-inverter applications, flyback topologies are a relevant research topic due to their efficiency and simplicity. On the other hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the fastest growing and most promising renewable energy sources in the world. A power electronic converter (either DC/DC or DC/AC) is needed to interface the PV array with the load/grid. In this paper, a modified interleaved-type step-up DC–DC flyback converter is presented for a PV application. The topology is based on a multi-winding flyback converter with N parallel connected inputs and a single output. Each input is supplied by an independent PV module, and a maximum power point tracking algorithm is implemented in each module to maximize solar energy harvesting. A single flyback transformer is used, and it manages only 1/N of the converter rated power, reducing the size of the magnetic core compared to other similar topologies. The design of the magnetic core isalso presented in this work. Moreover, the proposed converter includes active snubber networks to increase the efficiency, consisting of a capacitor connected in series with a power switch, to protect the main switches from damaging dv/dt when returning part of the commutation energy back to the source. In this work, the operating principle of the topology is fully described on a mathematical basis, and an efficiency analysis is also included. The converter is simulated and experimentally validated with a 1 kW prototype considering three PV panels. The experimental results are in agreement with the simulations, verifying the feasibility of the proposal. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;-;English;Article

Nonetheless, the MMC requires significant large DC storage capacitors. This work addresses the recently introduced Asymmetric Alternate Arm Converter (A3C), a hybrid MMC topology which uses modular arms only on the lower side of the main converter whereas the upper side uses only standard ON-OFF valves. The A3C offers a significant reduction in DC energy storage requirements and in the number of modules. In addition, it offers a less restricted operation than the Alternate Arm Converter (A2C), in terms of operating over a wide range of AC to DC voltage ratio, and the possibility of achieving both nearly sinusoidal AC current and nearly constant DC current.The principle of operation of the A3C, but in the inverter mode and using thyristor-based director switches, is revisited here and a suitable control strategy to demonstrate its operation is developed. Emphasis is place on switching off the thyristor valves in a soft commutation fashion. The method requires two A3C operating in interleaving fashion on the DC bus.

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Metropolitan Region, Santiago, Chile;The copper mineral processing industry faces complex scenarios with increased demand, highly variable energy prices, falling ore grades that increase energy consumption, and increasing concern about the industry's carbon footprint. To reduce the risk imposed by these scenarios, the industry is looking at the use of renewable energy sources. Considering that the most important copper mines in Chile are situated in regions with high radiation levels, solar energy has the potential to be an attractive and sustainable source of energy. This paper provides an overview of the current solar technologies and how they have been applied to address some of the challenges faced by the copper mining industry today. It describes the use of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic technologies to produce power and heat for the copper mining processes. Indeed, solar photovoltaic technologies can be used to produce electricity for the comminution machines, electro-refineries and water pumping while solar thermal technologies are useful for electricity generation, heat production, thermal leaching and drying of copper concentrate. The review also analyzes, from a broader perspective, the potential of these technologies in the operation and design of new solar copper mineral processes.

The controllers for both grid forming and grid following wind turbines include fault-ride-through capability with soft restoration of the off-shore AC-grid. Current and voltage controllers are developed in the stationary αβ reference frame. The presented control and soft restoration strategies are based on local measurements only and do not require communication between wind turbine generators. The small-signal stability analysis of the mixed system in multiple d-q axis using detailed string models is carried out in order to show the sensitivity to grid following phase-locked-loop gains and to grid forming droop gains.

The main research is focused on increasing the converter voltage gain while obtaining a good efficiency and reliability. Among the different DC-DC converters, the flyback topology is well-known and widely used. In this paper, a novel high efficiency modified step-up DC-DC flyback converter is presented. The converter is based on a N-stages flyback converter with parallel connected inputs and series-connected outputs. The use of a single main diode and output capacitor reduces the number of passive elements and allows for a more economical implementation compared with interleaved flyback topologies. High efficiency is obtained by including an active snubber circuit, which returns the energy stored in the leakage inductance of the flyback transformers back to the input power supply. A 4.7 kW laboratory prototype is implemented considering four flyback stages with an input voltage of 96 V and an output voltage of 590 V, obtaining an efficiency of 95%. The converter operates in discontinuous current mode then facilitating the output voltage controller design. Experimental results are presented and discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

Notwithstanding, the MMC requires significant large DC storage capacitors to mitigate for the large power pulsations that result from the single-phase AC to DC conversion process in their arms. The Alternate Arm Converter (AAC), which combines MMC arms with conventional valves (Director Switch), has the potential to cut the number of modules to half of that of the conventional MMC. Further, it is capable of blocking DC faults, an appealing feature for future DC networks. However, the AAC incurs higher power losses than conventional MMC. This work proposes the use of thyristors, instead of IGBTs, to implement the DSs of the AAC. This reduces conduction losses in DSs by approximately a half and makes the AAC more comparable to the conventional MMC, in terms of power losses, but with the advantage of reduced DC energy storage requirements. The principle of operation of the AAC, considering thyristor based DSs, is revisited here and a suitable control strategy to demonstrate its basic operation is developed. Proposals are verified through simulation studies using a switching converter model. Results confirm feasibility of proposed thyristor based DS and good performance of the proposed AAC. © 2018 IEEE.;Automation- HVDC power transmission- Industry 4.0- Process control- Thyristors- Ac to dc conversions- alternate arm converter- Control strategies- HVDC- Integration of renewable energies- Modular multilevel converters- Storage requirements- Switching converter- Rectifying circuits;Spanish;Conference Paper

Moreover, it is a desirable characteristic to keep the power injected to grid constant during the fault. This paper explores a control strategy to regulate the active and reactive powers delivered by a single-stage photovoltaic generation system to the grid during asymmetrical voltage faults. The reference for the active power is obtained from a maximum power point tracking algorithm, whereas the reference for the reactive power can be set freely if the zero-sequence voltage is null- otherwise, it will depend on the magnitude of the zero-sequence voltage and the active power reference. The power control loop generates the reference currents to be imposed by the grid-tied power inverter. These currents are regulated by a predictive controller. The proposed approach is simpler than other methods proposed in the literature. The performance of the control strategy presented is verified with an experimental laboratory setup where voltage sags and swells are considered. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Electric current control- Electric inverters- Electric power transmission networks- Maximum power point trackers- Power control- Power generation- Reactive power- Solar energy- Solar power generation- Active and reactive power- Experimental laboratory- Grid connected PV system- Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms- Photovoltaic generation system- Photovoltaic inverters- Voltage sags and swells- Zero sequence voltage- Electric power system control;English;Article

These systems are suitable for hose applications where there is lack of space and both types of energy are needed. Both electric and thermal power obtained from the PV/T systems, can be optimized through proper control strategies. In this work, three optimizing control strategies are compared. The first strategy uses a model to calculate the gradient of the generated power, the second is based on the perturbation-averaging extremum seeking approach, and the third is based on a time-varying extremum seeking control. Lyapunov theory is used in all the cases for convergence analysis. Simulation results show that all three strategies reach their objectives. The main differences were in terms of the implementation complexity, signals waveforms and the convergence times.

Since many mineral processing plants are located in desert regions with high solar radiation levels, companies are looking at solar energy, as a renewable energy source, to supply their energy needs. This work describes two examples of Solar Energy Systems (SES) integration into mineral processing plants. They provide an overview of the current challenges and deliver some lights about opportunities for further developments. The first example describes a hybridization strategy- i.e. a combination of different energy resources, to meet the energy demand of a large water pumping station. The second example illustrates an application where a load shifting strategies is designed to match the cyclic behavior of the energy sources. The main conclusion of this work, is that given the characteristics of solar energy systems and the operation of current mineral processing plants, optimization and control are key enabling techniques to make an efficient use of this renewable energy source.

Moreover, series connected diode rectifier units allow for increased reliability as the system is capable of reduced power operation in the case of the failure of one unit. However, a DR unit outage requires a reduced DC voltage, consequently, the use of full bridge MML power converters at the on-shore station. Such converters allow for reduced HVDC-link voltage operation when one diode rectifier unit is faulty and also help to improve transient response during faults. However, the full bridge MML is more complex than its half bridge counterpart and has higher losses. In this paper a study has been carried out to ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of using a mixed full-bridge half-bridge MML power converter for the diode rectifier connection of off-shore wind farms, highlighting the operational limits of each type of MML converter under a reduced DC voltage. © 2018 IEEE.;Diodes- Electric power generation- Electric power system interconnection- Electric utilities- HVDC power transmission- Outages- Rectifying circuits- Transient analysis- Wind power- Diode rectifier- HVDC transmission control- Loss reduction- Operational limits- Power operation- Power system harmonics- Series-connected- Voltage operations- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

Nevertheless, the MMC requires significant large DC storage capacitors to mitigate for the large power pulsations that result from the single-phase like AC to DC conversion process that takes place in the arms. This work addresses a converter topology which uses modular multilevel arms only on the lower side of the MMC converter whereas the upper side uses only standard ON-OFF valves. This corresponds to a limit case of the Alternate Arm Converter (AAC) with no module on the upper side and no director switch on the lower side, i.e. an Asymmetrical ACC. Like the AAC, the Asymmetric AAC offers a significant reduction in DC energy storage requirements. In addition, the Asymmetric AAC offers a less restricted operation than the AAC, in terms of operating over a wide range of AC to DC voltage ratio, and the possibility of achieving both distortion-free AC current and ripple-free DC current. The principle of operation of the Asymmetric AAC is explained in detail and a suitable control strategy to demonstrate its operation is developed.

The topology includes an input matrix converter stage, which provides the dc voltage for a four-leg voltage source converter (VSC) output stage. The VSC's fourth leg provides a path for the zero sequence load current. The control technique is based on a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy, whereby the switching states for the input and output converters are selected by evaluating a predictive cost function. This results in a simpler approach than that seen in other well-known modulation methods, such as three-dimensional space vector modulation (3D-SVM). Positive dc voltage, (a requirement for the safe operation of the IMC) and minimization of the instantaneous input reactive power are obtained, while maintaining good tracking of the load reference currents.

The use of Diode Rectifier units for the connection of off-shore wind power plants has been proposed as a technical alternative to reduce both installation and operating costs. Adequate management of the harmonics introduced by the use of the Diode Rectifier is of paramount importance for a robust operation of the complete system. This paper studies a comparison between two different alternatives for harmonic mitigation in large off-shore wind farms connected by HVDC Diode Rectifiers, namely, the use of a 12-pulse rectifier with capacitor and filter banks and the use of 24-pulse rectifier without capacitor or filter banks. The technical feasibility study of the use of a 24-pulse rectifier is included, together with its influence on overall losses and wind turbine converter and transformer ratings.;Cost reduction- Diodes- Electric power generation- Filter banks- Harmonic analysis- HVDC power transmission- Offshore oil well production- Operating costs- Power plants- Rectifying circuits- Transmissions- Wind power- Diode rectifier- Feasibility studies- Harmonic mitigation- HVDC transmission control- Off-shore wind energy- Off-shore wind power- Power system harmonics- Technical alternatives- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

For that purpose, detailed models of the dc cable, MMC stations, and transformers have been used in order to obtain reliable results. The influence of the WPP control method in the short-circuit behavior of the HVDC link has also been studied. Results show that the dynamics of the WPP contribution to pole-to-ground faults are slightly slower than those of the wind turbines current control loops. Therefore, the wind turbine front-end converters can be used to reduce the peak and average value of the fault current in such a system. Moreover, it has been found that ferroresonant oscillations can appear in the offshore ac grid when the WPP delivers constant power during faults. © 2015 IEEE.;DC power transmission- DC transformers- Electric power transmission networks- Electric utilities- HVDC power transmission- Power converters- Wind power- Wind turbines- Current control loop- Fault analysis- Ferroresonant oscillations- Front-end converters- High voltage direct current- HVDC grid- Modular multi-level converters- Offshore wind power plants- Offshore wind farms;English;Article

The scheme resembles a direct frequency converter using the cascade converter in its simplest form (series strings of H-bridge modules equipped with a dc link capacitor) as the building block of the overall converter. This yields a highly modular implementation approach which may be attractive for large power applications such as intertie connections and variable speed drives. Frequency conversion takes place in a cascade converter which connects the input and output ports. Two other converters are placed, respectively, in parallel to the input, to remove unwanted current components from the input, and the output to regulate output voltage. Operation of this topology is explained and a scheme to control all the converters is developed, including control of converter currents, capacitor voltages, and output voltage. Experimental results, using a low-power prototype, confirm the foundations of the topology and verify its overall performance operating as a power supply at typical output frequencies (25 Hz, 16 2/3Hz and dc) while being fed from a 50-Hz system. Additionally, PowerSIM simulations demonstrate that the topology may be suitable for implementing high-performance, high-power ac drive systems using vector control techniques. © 2012 IEEE.;Capacitors- Optical frequency conversion- Rotary converters- Variable speed drives- Building blockes- Capacitor voltages- Cascade converters- Cascade multilevel converter- Current component- Dc link capacitor- H-bridges- High power applications- High-power ac drives- Input and outputs- Large power- Low Power- Modular implementation- Multilevel converter- Output frequency- Output voltages- Power conversion- Power supply- Vector control techniques- Topology;English;Article

Higher efficiency, better power to size ratio and less mechanical stress in the system are some of the characteristics of variable speed generators. In particular, variable speed diesel generators can be used to provide small highly portable generation systems for emergency vehicles and military/aerospace applications. Such systems can be used to feed stand-alone linear/non-linear loads if an adequate power converter interface is provided. Four-leg matrix converters can be used as the power electronic interface between variable speed generators and stand-alone loads. The fourth leg provides a neutral point for single phase loads and a path for the circulation of zero sequence currents. When non-linear loads are connected to the matrix converter output, relatively high harmonic distortion can be produced in the load voltage unless an appropriate control system is provided. In this paper the application of a repetitive control system to improve the quality of the load voltage is presented.

However, the conventional DFIG requires brushes and copper slip-rings to connect a power converter to the rotor windings. The use of brushes decreases the WECS' robustness and extra maintenance is required to periodically inspect/replace these elements. In this work a new topology for a Brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (BDFIG) is presented. As an alternative to conventional Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) a matrix converter is used to regulate the current supplied to the stator of the doubly-fed machine, supplying the excitation energy to the WECS. The proposed generation system is mathematically analysed in this paper and the design of the control loops is discussed. Because the power spectrum density of the wind speed is dominated by low frequency components, in this work some simplifications of the transfer functions of the system are proposed. Experimental results obtained from a 3 kW prototype of a cascaded DFIG, are presented and fully discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This method uses the commutation state of the converter in the subsequent sampling time according to an optimization algorithm given by a simple cost function and a discrete system model. The control goals are the regulation of the output current according to an arbitrary reference and tracking of the source current reference, which is imposed in order to obtain sinusoidal waveforms with low distortion. The technique is enhanced by a reduction of the common-mode voltage using an extra term in the cost function to reduce early motor winding failure and bearing deterioration.

In particular, in many applications the output maps are defined in terms of an implicit function. In this context, it is necessary to design an observer which does not require to invert explicitly the output map in order to obtain the estimated output. The proposed approach considers this particular requirement, a nonlinear perturbation term associated to the dynamic part, characterized in terms of a Lipschitz constant, and a continuous differentiable output map. The stability of the non-linear error dynamic is analysed by transforming the error dynamic into a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system. Two representative examples, i.e. neutralization process and conductivity estimation, illustrate the main features of the design process and the performance obtained with the proposed observer. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To interface a MC-based generation system to an unbalanced three-phase stand-alone load, a four-leg MC is required to provide an electrical path for the zero-sequence load current. Moreover, to compensate for the voltage drops in the output filter inductances, nonlinearities introduced by the four-step commutation method and voltage drops in the semiconductor devices, closed-loop regulation of the load voltage is required.

España 1680, Valparaíso, Chile- Universidad de Concepción, Victor Lamas 1290, Concepción, Chile- University of Nottingham, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nottingham, United Kingdom;While the known modulation and control techniques for four-leg matrix converters are based on pulse width modulation or three-dimensional space vector modulation, this paper presents a simple current control strategy based on prediction calculation to select the switching states of the converter. By using a predictive cost function, the optimal switching state to be applied to the next sampling time is selected. This is done in order to minimize the instantaneous reactive power on the input side and to obtain a positive dc-link voltage at any time, while maintaining a good tracking of the load currents to their respective references. The feasibility of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation results. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.;AC/AC converter- Converter controls- Digital control- Matrix converter- Modulation strategy- Optimal controls- Power supply- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)- DC power transmission- Digital control systems- Electric current control- Electric inverters- Modulation- Optimization- Power converters- Power electronics- Pulse width modulation- Reactive power- Vector spaces- Uninterruptible power systems;English;Conference Paper

Nottingham, United Kingdom;The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) is one of the most widely used generators for wind energy applications and more of 50% of the installed Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS) are using this sort of variable speed technology. However, the machine requires brushes for the operation which increases the maintenance work. To overcome this drawback a Brushless Double Fed Induction Generator (BDFIG), composed of two cascaded doubly-fed machines with the rotor windings interconnected, could be used. In this work, the control of a BDFIG is presented using a matrix converter (MC). Matrix converters may be seen as suitable converter choice for this application instead of the standard back-to-back PWM voltage source converter topology. Results from an experimental rig are presented for operation of the BDFIG at variable speed with the machine driven by a commercial AC drive as a prime mover. © 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.;AC drives- AC machine- Control of drive- Double fed induction generator- Doubly-fed induction generator- Doublyfed machines- Maintenance work- Matrix converter- Prime movers- Rotor windings- Variable speed- Voltage source converters- Wind energy conversion system- AC generator motors- Asynchronous generators- Energy conversion- Power electronics- Wind power- Power converters;English;Conference Paper

The capability of the input converter to generate different ""virtual dc link"" voltage levels is exploited. The commutation of the VSI with reduced voltage is illustrated for operating points where the output voltage demand is low without any deterioration of the current control performance. The proposed method leads to a reduction in the commutation losses in the output converter and reduced common-mode voltage. For the input converter, soft switching commutation is obtained by synchronizing the input and output converter pulsewidth-modulation patterns. This modulation strategy is particularly applicable in DFIG applications because the required rotor voltage decreases when the DFIG speed is close to the synchronous speed. The complete control strategy is experimentally validated using a 2-kW rig. © 2011 IEEE.";AC machine- Common mode voltage- Commutation loss- Complete control- Control strategies- DC links- DC voltage- Doubly fed induction generators- Doubly-fed induction generator- Indirect matrix converter- Input and outputs- Machine vector controls- Matrix converter- Modulation strategy- Operating points- Output voltages- Rotor voltage- Synchronous speed- Voltage levels- Voltage source converters- AC generator motors- Asynchronous generators- Counting circuits- Electric fault currents- Modulation- Soft switching- Vector spaces- Power converters;English;Article

The scheme uses two back-to-back PWM inverters connected between the stator and the rotor, namely the rotor side and stator side converters respectively. The stator current and voltage unbalances are reduced or eliminated by injecting compensation currents into the grid/load using the stator side converter. The proposed control strategy is based on two revolving axes rotating synchronously at ±ωe. From these axes, the d-q components of the negative and positive-sequence currents, in the stator and grid/load, are obtained. The scheme compensates the negative-sequence currents in the grid/load by supplying negative-sequence currents via the stator side converter. Experimental results obtained from a 2-kW experimental prototype are presented and discussed in this work.

Depending on the required output voltage, the modulation of the input matrix converter is changed in order to obtain a lower/higher DC voltage without causing over modulation The strategy could be applied to a cage induction machine drive, operating at low speed and therefore requiring low voltage, or a doubly-fed induction machine drive operating near synchronous speed where the required rotor voltage is smaller.

The use of an uncontrolled rectifier instead of a line commutated thyristor (LCT) rectifier represents clear advantages in terms of installation cost and operation reliability. However, the rectifier can no longer be used to limit the HVDC link current during on-shore grid faults. The present paper introduces a method to control the HVDC link voltage and current by modifying the off-shore ac grid voltage, which, in turn, is controlled by the wind turbines. Simulation results show good performance in steady state and during on-shore ac grid faults. ©2009 IEEE.;AC-grid- Fault analysis- Grid fault- HVDC link- HVDC transmission control- Installation costs- Off-shore- Operation reliability- Simulation result- Steady state- Uncontrolled rectifiers- Wind farm- Asynchronous generators- Electric converters- Electric generators- Electric power generation- Electric switchgear- Electric utilities- Farms- HVDC power transmission- Industrial electronics- Synchronous generators- Wind power- Electric rectifiers;English;Conference Paper

The rotor position is obtained using the unsaturated instantaneous inductance. This unsaturated inductance is estimated calculating the slope of the phase current and using a reduced-size neural network (NN) whose inputs are the average current and the saturated inductance. The proposed estimator requires less processing time than traditional methods and can be fully implemented using a low-cost DSP with very few additional analog/digital components. The rotor position estimator presented in this paper can be applied to a wind energy conversion system where the SRG is used as a variable-speed generator. This application is currently being studied because the SRG has well-known advantages such as robustness, low manufacturing cost, and good size-to-power ratio.

This work aims to achieve a simplified and accurate method to detect the emergency braking intention employing EEG signals and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Three main problems: computer resources, network accuracy, and the training time are defined to accomplish this aim. While a CNN is an efficient image-based classifier, it increases computing resources and processing time. Therefore, we solved these problems by training a CNN through a 2D matrices tensor designed to work with a very large database without transforming the EEG signals into grayscale images and running on a free cloud platform. However, we are well aware that physical fatigue while driving increases the mental load. Consequently, we measured the braking reaction time that proves an increment over time, negatively affecting the participants’ performance. The linear correlation between the target and non-target classes on the matrices tensor reveals that most emergency events can be very well-differentiated from not anomalous driving. The CCN accuracy is over 84% with just four electrodes-scalp, comparable to reported grayscale-based methods. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;Convolutional neural networks- Driver training- Machine learning- Computer resources- Convolutional neural network- EEG signals- Gray-scale images- Machine learning algorithms- matrix- Mental state- Network accuracy- Prediction methods- Training time- Learning algorithms;English;Article

The measurement device works for impedance measurements ranging from 1 Ω to 1800 Ω. Fifteen volunteers were measured with the prototype. We found that the left hemithorax has higher impedance compared to the right hemithorax, and the acquired signal presents the phases of the respiratory cycle with variations between 1 Ω, in normal breathing, to 6 Ω in maximum inhalation events. The system can measure the respiratory cycle variations simultaneously in both hemithorax with a mean error of −0.18 ± 1.42 BPM (breaths per minute) in the right hemithorax and −0.52 ± 1.31 BPM for the left hemithorax, constituting a useful device for the breathing rate calculation and possible screening applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Unfortunately, given the high sensitivity of health data and the uncertainty in user environments, user-centric healthcare systems inevitably suffer from more frequent privacy threats, not to mention that technologies and business of data exploitation have generally outpaced the current privacy regulations and laws. Although there exist well-defined privacy preserving mechanisms, such as Data Encryption, Data Perturbation, and De-identification, they have been considered inadequate to address the diverse privacy challenges in big healthcare data analytics. Our argument is that, before considering any sophisticated mechanism, practitioners should first try to imitate human memory's forgetting process as an intrinsic privacy preserving strategy in user-centric healthcare. Technically, we implement this strategy by changing traditional data analytics routines into a distributed and disposable manner, so as to naturally exclude the data owners' sensitive information. The technical implementation essentially acts as a concrete How-To solution to satisfying a fundamental principle of privacy law, i.e. data minimization. We have initially applied our work to a smart bed project for sleep quality analytics, and received positive feedback on the effectiveness of privacy preservation in suitable homecare scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.;Big data- Cryptography- Data Analytics- Health care- Health risks- Laws and legislation- Homecare- Microservice- Privacy preservation- Smart bed- User-centric- Data privacy;English;Conference Paper

The system is a technological educational application intended to stimulate learning abilities, developed as a native mobile application for devices with Android operating system. It is specially designed for children between 2 and 4 years of age, to stimulate language, contingency and attention, through cognitive tasks in the form of interactive mini-games. The activities teach the association between images with the corresponding infrequently used spoken words, and images of letters with the corresponding sounds (i.e. phonemes). The mini-games are based on multimedia resources, mainly videos of an educator, real objects and animals. The software evaluates progress by measuring interaction parameters such as correct answers and response time and has an algorithm to randomize the trials across children. The application is tested in 314 2-4 year-old children. Each child played a minimum of 8 sessions every other day, each one presenting 6 words and 4 letters, and testing for 3 words and 2 letters. Results showed that ISLACS is an attractive game for young children, which significantly succeeded to teach children the sounds of the letters and a repertory of nearly 48 infrequent words in Spanish, in a brief intervention. © 2019 IEEE.;Engineering- Industrial engineering- Cognitive task- Educational Applications- Interaction parameters- Interactive system- Learning abilities- Mobile applications- Multimedia resources- Young children- Multimedia systems;English;Conference Paper

The electrochemical kinetics of cells is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition allows enhancing cathode quality, electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, early identification of temperature excursions, and electrolyte flow blockages. Abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation, higher energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, and safety issues because the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations. With real-time information about electrolyte variables, it is possible to provide early warnings to face the wide variability of cell performance and safety conditions caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a noninvasive wireless sensor for monitoring the electrolyte temperature inside cells and estimates the electrolyte circulation flow through each cell simultaneously. The sensor design is suitable to highly corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition-monitoring sensor proposed is small in size, lightweight, and meets battery-free operation and nonsparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a radio frequency-link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation not suitable for electrolytic process monitoring. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Cathodes- Condition monitoring- Copper- Electrolytic cells- Energy utilization- Monitoring- Process monitoring- Production- Temperature measurement- Temperature sensors- Condition monitoring sensors- Electrochemical kinetics- Electrolyte circulations- Electrolyte temperature- Electrolytic process- Harsh environment- Harsh environment sensor- Wireless sensor- Electrolytes;English;Article

New electromechanical film (EMFi) sensors are now able to detect minimal oscillations in its surface, allowing to detect the mechanical action of the heart as it beats. This has allowed to develop unobtrusive systems for heart rate monitoring to be used as Point-of-Care devices, and to deploy them in waiting rooms, assisted living facilities or at home. In this work, an EMFi sensor is used to measure BCG via the pressure changes on the seat produced by the beating heart. In a lab environment, 34 healthy volunteers are measured under two conditions: at rest and after exercise, simultaneously with ECG. Also, in a clinical environment, 24 volunteers are also measured while waiting. The algorithm looks for the variability of the length transform at different scales or windows to determine a search window to detect beats from the BCG. A second correlation filter helps eliminate false peaks detected due to noise in the signal. Results show that in resting conditions, the mean error between the BCG HR and the reference ECG is only 0.4 beats per minute, with a standard deviation of 1.88. The noise rejection accuracy is 93%. The proposed algorithm can be used to identify beats and issue alarms under abnormal rhythms, providing timely alerts for at-risk population. © 2017 IEEE.;Correlation detectors- Electrocardiography- Health care- Patient monitoring- At-risk population- Clinical environments- Correlation filters- Electromechanical film- Healthy volunteers- Heart-rate monitoring- Mechanical action- Standard deviation- Heart;English;Conference Paper

Battery life of wearable stimulators and wireless power transmission in implanted systems are common limiting factors. Boost DC/DC converters are typically needed to increase the supply voltage of the output stage. Traditionally, boost DC/DC converters are used with fast control to regulate the supply voltage of the output. However, since stimulators are acting as current sources, such voltage regulation is not needed. Banking on this, this paper presents a DC/DC conversion strategy aiming to increase power efficiency. It compares, in terms of efficiency, the traditional use of boost converters to two alternatives that could be implemented in future hardware designs. © 2017 IEEE.;equipment design- power supply- prostheses and orthoses- Electric Power Supplies- Equipment Design- Prostheses and Implants;English;Conference Paper

A good washing procedure aids stopping the inflammatory and infectious process generated after the contamination due to the perforation of a hollow viscera. COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to simulate the biomechanical behavior of the liver against localized pressure. A graphical interface allows the user to predict liver deformation under different fluid pressures and positions simulating the lavage procedure.

Two intercell technologies for designing these busbars are presently available: current source (CS) or voltage source. For this research project, we selected CS based on tankhouse operational data that consistently show better performance than its counterpart. Both technologies can be implemented in dogbone or central busbar configurations. Dogbone was chosen because of the better contact distance and larger heatsink area. The proposed design ensures hot swapability. Conventional busbars suffer premature aging, corrosion, and contact deterioration. Industrial samples show these phenomena. Multiphysics finite-element method modeling highlights the origin of this accelerated aging. This work provides design guidelines for S-shaped connectors to overcome previous design flaws.

A myoelectric control strategy based on artificial neural networks is implemented on a microcontroller for online position estimation. Position estimation performance achieves a correlation index of 0.78. Also a study involving transcutaneous electrical stimulation was performed to provide tactile feedback. A series of stimulations with controlled parameters were tested on five able-body subjects. A single channel stimulator was used, positioning the electrodes 8 cm on the wrist over the ulnar and median nerve. Controlling stimulation parameters such as intensity, frequency and pulse width, the subjects were capable of distinguishing different sensations over the palm of the hand. Three main sensations where achieved: tickling, pressure and pain. Tickling and pressure were discretized into low, moderate and high according to the magnitude of the feeling. The parameters at which each sensation was obtained are further discussed in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.;adult- electrode- electromyography- finger- forearm- hand- human- limb prosthesis- pathophysiology- physiology- sensory feedback- theoretical model- three dimensional printing- time factor- touch- transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation- vibration- young adult- Adult- Artificial Limbs- Electrodes- Electromyography- Feedback, Sensory- Fingers- Forearm- Hand- Humans- Models, Theoretical- Printing, Three-Dimensional- Time Factors- Touch- Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation- Vibration- Young Adult;English;Conference Paper

The actual physical condition of the plate, hanger bar assembly, and the internal resistance of electrodes are critical factors in this process. Internal electrode resistances affect parallel anode-cathode pair resistances. Therefore, it also alters balanced copper deposits, current efficiency, and cell voltage and power consumption of electrowinning cells. This paper summarizes the design characteristics of commercial stainless steel cathodes and cold-rolled lead-alloy anodes. It includes the evaluation of electrode performances under typical operating conditions using 3-D finite-element method analysis. The proposed evaluation of internal electrode resistance comprises nonlinear effects of electrical conduction, heat generation, and electrode position. The analysis of the design robustness of electrodes considers the most important elements, which help to maintain high current efficiency and electrical performance in the long term- that is to say, mechanical strength, inherent straightness, resistance to dissolution of copper coating on hanger bars, galvanic corrosion of weld joints, and hanger bar resistance to annealing. Results are based on industrial measurements, test work by vendors, and tankhouse operating data for benchmarking. The performance evaluation considers internal electrical resistance, contact shape design, contact loading, average contact resistance, and lifetime current efficiency.

The electrochemical kinetics of electrolytic processes is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition integrated to operation and housekeeping procedures, allows enhancing cathode quality and electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, and early identification of temperature excursions and electrolyte flow blockages. These abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation and energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, or safety issues from the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations and providing early warnings to face the wide variability of performance and safety conditions of cells caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a non-invasive wireless sensor for the monitoring of the temperature and electrolyte circulation flow estimation through each cell, suitable to highly-corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition monitoring sensor design is small size, lightweight, meets battery-free operation and non-sparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a RF link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation currently used for electrolytic process monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Cathodes- Condition monitoring- Copper- Electric batteries- Electrodes- Electrolytic cells- Energy utilization- Monitoring- Process monitoring- Production- Battery-free operations- Condition monitoring sensors- Electrochemical kinetics- Electrolyte circulations- Electrolytic process- Harsh environment- Harsh environment sensor- Wireless sensor- Electrolytes;English;Conference Paper

It consists of several sensors deployed on a wheelchair, able to sense pressure relief habits, activity level, vital signs, and ambient conditions. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the potential capabilities of the system and the feasibility of implementing alarms. During a period of two weeks, six full-time wheelchair users were monitored. Results show that the system is able to capture pressure relief patterns and tilt-in-space usage, a mechanism required to avoid pressure ulcers. Data analysis shows that none of the volunteers fully complied with the tilting recommendations. It also shows varied activity levels, both within and between patients, indicating their engagement in daily activities. The system is also able to estimate heart and respiration rate during passive activities (e.g., watching TV and/or resting). Also, high temperatures in summer were monitored while patients were outside, to prevent heatstroke events. All the monitored variables are acquired with unobtrusive sensors, producing no discomfort to the patient and providing valuable information for better care.

Two intercell technologies for designing these busbars are currently available: current source or voltage source. In this research current source is selected based on tankhouse operational data that consistently show better performance than its counterpart. Both technologies can be implemented in dogbone or central busbar configurations. Dogbone is chosen because provides better contact distance and larger heatsink area. On top of these attributes hot swapability is ensured by design. Also, the use of flat shaped solid hangers for anodes and cathodes is advised in order to preserve contact integrity. Industrial data is examined including samples of premature aging, corrosion and contact deterioration. Multi-physics FEM modeling highlights the heat source of this accelerated aging. This work provides design guidelines for S shaped connectors for the intercell aiming to overcome previous design flaws exhibited by those evidences. For completeness, the paper includes a design example for an industrial site. The resulting design surpasses standard design practices and secures a hot spot free operation. © 2015 IEEE.;Busbars- Copper- Corrosion- Electrodes- Finite element method- Accelerated aging- Current sources- Industrial datum- Industrial sites- Intercell- Operational data- Premature aging- Standard design- Design;English;Conference Paper

It uses unobtrusive Electro-Mechanical Films (EMFi) on the seat and on the backrest of a regular chair. The system detects ballistocardiogram (BCG) and respiration movements. Real data was obtained from 54 volunteers. 19 of them were measured in the laboratory and 35 in a hospital waiting room. Using a BIOPAC acquisition system, the ECG was measured simultaneously to the BCG for comparison. Wavelet Transform (WT) is a better option than Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for signal extraction and produces higher effective measurement time. In the laboratory, the best results are obtained on the seat. The correlation index was 0.9800 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were 0.7136 ± 4.3673 [BPM]. In the hospital waiting room, the best results are also from the seat sensor. The correlation index was 0.9840, and the limits of agreement were 0.4386 ± 3.5884 [BPM]. The system is able to measure BCG in an unobtrusive way and determine the cardiac frequency with high precision.

The sleep quality of mine workers is an important issue related to both goals. Miners are usually exposed to hard working shifts in a hostile environment, which can lead to deficient rest between shifts. Inadequate sleep is related to fatigue and higher risk of accidents. Sleep quality is traditionally evaluated by specialized medical personnel through polysomnography by measuring apneas, body movements (BMs), and the time in bed (TB), among other parameters, trying to determine the sleep depth. We present a noninvasive sleep evaluation device based on pressure sensors on the bed that can be used to measure relevant parameters to estimate sleep quality. This device can be easily unobtrusively installed at mining facilities and provide the TB, the respiration frequency, BMs, apnea events, and the sleep depth. We present preliminary results that validate the device for future studies at mining sites and as a new hazard control mechanism. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Mineral industry- Sleep research- Hostile environments- Medical personnel- Non-invasive monitoring- Polysomnography- Respiration frequency- Risk of accidents- Sleep monitoring- Sleep quality- Quality control;English;Article

Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices, Proceedings- Part of 7th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, BIOSTEC 2014;0;Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepcion, I-Concepción, Chile;Nocturnal bruxism (NB) is a temporomandibular disorder characterized by an excessive clenching and involuntary parafunctional grinding of the teeth during sleep. In this paper, we present a device that generates electrical stimulation to produce an inhibitory action of the muscles involved in the elevation of the jaw. The device measures the electromyographic (EMG) signal of the left temporalis anterior (LTa) muscle to determine the intensity of contraction. It then, stimulates the right mental nerve to produce a decrease in the contraction intensity of the jaw elevation muscles. The device was used by one bruxist subject for 12 nights. The results showed that, on average, the percentage decrease of the EMG activity was 43.55% when a bruxism event occurred. The events of nocturnal bruxism appeared mostly one and three hours after going to sleep. In conclusion, the electrical stimulation device generated an important inhibitory action of the LTa muscle when the subject was performing nocturnal bruxism. Thus, this result indicates that the device could be useful as a possible treatment for bruxism. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications.

The clinical narrative text was processed using natural language processing techniques, and annotated by four people with a biomedical background. The dataset used for classification had 2,465 documents, each one annotated with one of the four smoking status categories. We used two feature representations: single word token and bigrams. The classification problem was divided in two levels. First recognizing between smoker (S) and non-smoker (NS)- second recognizing between current smoker (CS) and past smoker (PS). For each feature representation and classification level, we used two classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Bayesian Networks (BN). We split our dataset as follows: a training set containing 66% of the available documents that was used to build classifiers and a test set containing the remaining 34% of the documents that was used to test and evaluate the model. Our results show that SVM together with the bigram representation performed better in both classification levels. For S vs NS classification level performance measures were: ACC=85%, Precision=85%, and Recall=90%. For CS vs PS classification level performance measures were: ACC=87%, Precision=91%, and Recall=94%. © 2014 IEEE.;Bayesian networks- Information retrieval systems- Natural language processing systems- Statistical tests- Support vector machines- Bigrams- Feature representation- Natural languages- Performance measure- Single words- Status informations- Test sets- Training sets- Classification (of information)- Bayes theorem- Chile- classification- electronic medical record- factual database- human- natural language processing- smoking- support vector machine- verbal communication- Bayes Theorem- Chile- Databases, Factual- Electronic Health Records- Humans- Narration- Natural Language Processing- Smoking- Support Vector Machines;English;Conference Paper

The novelty in this paper is the proposal of three parameters to select the most representative source of AA. These parameters are correlation coefficient with lead V1 (CV1), peak factor (PF) and spectral concentration (SC). The first two parameters are introduced as new indicators, addressing features overlooked by the SC even when they are present in AA during AF. For synthesized data, at least two of the three parameters select the same representation of AA in 93.3% of the cases. For real data (218 ECG recordings), we observe that PF presents, in 89.5% of the cases, values between 2 and 4.5 for the selected sources, ensuring a well-defined range of values for AA. The actual values of CV1 and SC were scattered throughout their possible ranges (0-1 for CV1 and 0.08-0.7 for SC), and the correlation coefficient between these variables was found to be ρ = 0.58. We compared our results with three known algorithms: QRST cancellation, principal components analysis (PCA) and ICA-SOBI. The results obtained from this comparison show that our proposed methods to select the best representation of AA in general outperform the three above-mentioned algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Correlation coefficient- Independent component analysis(ICA)- Kurtosis- Principal components analysis- Second order blind identifications- Selection parameters- Algorithms- Blind source separation- Correlation methods- Diseases- Independent component analysis- Power spectral density- Principal component analysis- Electrocardiography- algorithm- article- electrocardiogram- heart atrium fibrillation- heart atrium function- human- independent component analysis- principal component analysis- priority journal- QRS complex- QT interval- recording- Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Blind source separation- Correlation- ECG- Kurtosis- Power spectral density- Selection parameters- Atrial Fibrillation- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Principal Component Analysis- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

In particular, the study of AF types or sub-classes is a very interesting research topic. In this paper we present a preliminary study to find sub-classes of AF from real 12-lead ECG recordings using k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms. We applied blind source separation to an initial set of 218 recordings from which we extracted a subset of 136 atrial activity signals displaying known properties of AF. As features for clustering we proposed the peak frequency mean value (PFM), peak frequency standard deviation (PFSD) and the spectral concentration (SC). We computed the silhouette coefficient to obtain an optimal number of clusters of k=5, and conducted preliminary feature selection to evaluate clustering quality. We observed that the separability increases if we discard SC as a feature. The proposed method is the first stage to a future AF classification method, which combined with specialist advice, should help in the clinical field. © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation- Classification methods- Clinical research- Clustering quality- Ecg measurements- Hierarchical clustering algorithms- Peak frequencies- Spectral concentrations- Blind source separation- Diseases- Electrocardiography- Frequency standards- Clustering algorithms- algorithm- atrial fibrillation- automated pattern recognition- cluster analysis- electrocardiography- heart atrium- human- normal distribution- pathophysiology- procedures- reproducibility- signal processing- Algorithms- Atrial Fibrillation- Cluster Analysis- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Normal Distribution- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Reproducibility of Results- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Conference Paper

The system detects changes in the contact pressure between a subject and the bed and is able to automatically select the sensor with the best respiratory signal, determine the respiratory rate (RR), count number of sleep apneas and count body position changes through the night. The respiratory signal is validated with an airflow sensor using Pearson's correlation coefficient. To determine the performance of body position and apnea detection algorithms, the sensibility and positive predictivity is computed on preliminary data and known records from a Physionet database. Real data is obtained from 5 subjects totaling 39 hours measured at home during a full night sleep, in a non-invasive way. The data is used to calculate relevant parameters to estimate a sleep quality.

It can cause dental damage and irreversible temporomandibular joint dysfunction. We designed a device that generates electrical stimulation on inhibitory sensory afferents when an EMG signal is measured. This stimulation was applied to the right mental nerve to produce a decrease in the contraction intensity of the mandibular elevation muscles. To measure the intensity of contraction, electromyographic (EMG) signal of the left temporalis anterior (LTa) muscle was used. The results showed that, on average, the percentage decrease in the bruxist group was 30.53% and for the control group was 28.91%. These results indicate that the device implemented generates an important decrease in the muscle contractile activity. Therefore, the device could be useful as a possible treatment to decrease nocturnal bruxism. © 2013 IEEE.;Control groups- Electrical stimulations- Electromyographic signal- EMG signal- Sensory afferents- Temporalis- Temporomandibular disorders- Temporomandibular joint- Electromyography- Muscle- adolescent- case control study- devices- electromyography- electrostimulation- electrostimulation therapy- female- human- male- muscle contraction- pathophysiology- physiology- Sleep Bruxism- temporalis muscle- treatment outcome- young adult- Adolescent- Case-Control Studies- Electric Stimulation- Electric Stimulation Therapy- Electromyography- Female- Humans- Male- Muscle Contraction- Sleep Bruxism- Temporal Muscle- Treatment Outcome- Young Adult;English;Conference Paper

Sleep quality of mine workers is an important issue related to both goals. Miners are usually exposed to hard working shifts in a hostile environment, without specialized medical supervision. Deficient rest during shifts is related to fatigue and risk of accidents. Sleep quality is usually evaluated through polysomnography by measuring apneas, body movements and time in bed among other parameters, trying to determine sleep depth. We present a non-invasive sleep evaluation device based on pressure sensors on the bed that can be used to measure relevant parameters to estimate sleep quality. This device can be easily installed unobtrusively at mining facilities and provide time in bed, respiration frequency, body movements, apnea events and sleep depth. We present preliminary results that validate the device for future studies at mining sites, as a possible hazard control mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.;Hazard control- Hostile environments- Non-invasive monitoring- Polysomnography- Respiration frequency- Risk of accidents- Sleep monitoring- Sleep quality- Industrial applications- Mining- Sleep research- Quality control;English;Conference Paper

Service availability depends on multiple resources, some of them redundant, to function properly. However, resource consumption varies according to patient's medical condition. The availability of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) depends both on basic components (electricity, water) and on requirements set by patient complexity and quantity. We propose using Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) as an estimator of patient complexity. Accumulated DRG (DRG a) represents the quantity/complexity combination that the ICU has to care for at any given moment. Our analysis allowed us to find the theoretical combination of patients that would collapse a clinical unit. This limit was deemed reasonable to expert advisors based on their experience at the ICU. The study was conducted for the adult ICU at the Clnica Universitaria de Concepcin, a teaching hospital in Con-cepcin, Chile. Data was collected during 4 months and analyzed using reliability theory. Overall reliability and availability results are consistent with incident reports at the Clinic. The procedure and recommendations for unit design and management are applicable to Clinical Units both at early planning stages or for currently working units. © 2011 IEEE.;Diagnosis related groups- Incident reports- Medical conditions- Multiple resources- Planning stages- Reliability and availability- Resource consumption- Service availability- Unit availability- Unit design- Reliability theory- Intensive care units- article- Chile- diagnosis related group- health care delivery- health service- human- intensive care- intensive care unit- methodology- severity of illness index- statistics- utilization review- Chile- Diagnosis-Related Groups- Health Services Accessibility- Health Services Needs and Demand- Humans- Intensive Care- Intensive Care Units- Severity of Illness Index- Utilization Review;English;Conference Paper

In the field of physiological monitoring, there are several goals that ambient intelligence can help us achieve. First, when patients are anxious, unobtrusive monitoring does not aggravate their anxiety. Second, when patients are at risk and there are insufficient caregivers to attend to each patient individually in a timely manner, unobtrusive pervasive monitoring can reassure patients that they are being cared for. Furthermore, caregivers appreciate being able to monitor more patients. The SMART system was developed to monitor patients' vital signs and locations in the waiting area of a hospital's emergency department.

Therefore, it is important to generate useful models that contribute to the operational study of such systems. In particular, it is important to make good use of droop schemes, since these are essential for achieving a correct operation. The main contribution of this article is the development of a combined model based on optimal power flow for radial multi-terminal HVDC grids. This model comprises two sub-models. The first sub-model, which considers the droop scheme associated to the active power loop, is established with the objective of minimizing losses over the DC lines. On the other hand, the second sub-model, which considers the droop scheme associated to the reactive power loop, is established with the objective of minimizing the total apparent power in converter stations and, consequently, minimizing their total losses. The combined model allows selecting the parameters and references associated to both droop schemes. The case study presented shows that the use of the combined model results in a correct grid operation, highlighting the contribution to the needs of the AC grid while maintaining the operational restrictions of the entire system.

However, given that environmental conditions change constantly, so does the ampacity of the conductor. This is why line thermal limitation should not be established in a conservative, fixed or invariable way. In the case of Chile, the Independent System Operator (ISO) establishes current-carrying capacity curves. Nevertheless, these are only a function of the ambient temperature in the presence of the sun. Such methodology is insufficient since it does not consider the effect of wind as the main conductor cooling mechanism. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new approach for a probabilistic current calculation model based on dynamic thermal rating. This approach accounts for the spatial and temporal variation of weather conditions along a line. The approach maximizes the line's current capacity by employing an iterative process based on the span identification that limits the conductor ampacity. Furthermore, the approach includes temperature restrictions to avoid conductor mechanical problems. The model is applied in the Chilean system, particularly to the Maitencillo–Nogales 220 kV transmission path. The new current limitations established by the proposed approach are compared to those set by the Chilean ISO and show significant increases in the current-carrying capacity of the lines and hence a better use of NCRE generation to lower production costs and CO 2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;Electric lines- Electric utilities- Iterative methods- Meteorology- Ampacity- Dynamic thermal ratings- Economic benefits- Overhead transmission lines- Probabilistic modeling- Static thermal rating- Dynamics;English;Article

In this context, demand and generation randomness (wind speed, solar radiation and rates of failure) are considered. Demand, wind speed, solar radiation and unavailability are modeled through Normal, Weibull, Beta and Uniform distributions respectively. The problem is therefore recognized as a stochastic process. Consequently, the cost of load shedding is considered. In order to define the optimal power allocation for each generator, the proposed methodology uses Group SO (3) orthogonal matrices (Lie's algebra), the marginal costs of the generators, the customer damage cost and MonteCarlo trials.

University of Concepcion, Chile- DI Inf. University of Concepcion, Chile;This work proposes a solution method for the unit commitment (UC) problem using the reinforcement learning (RL) technique. The UC problem is an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the electrical power system operational cost. The solution of an UC problem yields an operational schedule for a set of generation units while satisfying unit operational constraints and system demand. This paper considers a four-state definition (maximum, minimum, banking and off) for the thermal generation units. In this scenario, it is verified that the modelling of the UC problem has the markovian property which allows the use of the RL method and thus giving the possibility to solve the UC problem by the means of rewards. These rewards are derived from unit operational costs, the system demand and the electrical system constraints. A two-step algorithm is proposed for searching a solution (considering the subsequent and sub subsequent states) which allows the learning agent to be able to efficiently evaluate every alternative and choose the best available one. Finally, the method performance is measured considering a 10-unit system proving the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.;10-unit systems- Electrical power system- Electrical systems- Generation units- Learning agents- Markovian- Markovian process- Operational constraints- Optimization problems- Reinforcement learning solution- Reinforcement learning techniques- Solution methods- Thermal generation unit- Two-step algorithms- Unit commitment- Unit commitment problem- Reinforcement learning- Problem solving;English;Conference Paper

This consideration produces a dimensionality problem that is tackled through the imitation of the geometrical optimisation problem of molecular structures to reach its minimum energy state. Based on classical mechanics laws, the Geometric Optimisation (GO) process is imitated, where molecular structures can be optimised from an energy viewpoint. To achieve this, the Electric Power System (EPS) is modelled as a Molecular System (MS) composed of several virtual molecules where each one of them represents a generating unit. Thus, getting the minimum potential energy (via the van der Waals energy function) of the Molecular System is equivalent to obtain the minimum production cost of electric energy. To solve the problem, the Simulated Annealing (SA) technique is used as the optimisation technique. The EPS-MS model and method proposed here are validated in this work when calculating a 24-hour UC and its results are compared to an optimal solution analytically obtained and a solution using the conventional on/off states. © 2008 CRL Publishing Ltd.;Annealing- Electric power systems- Industrial economics- Mechanics- Molecular mechanics- Molecular structure- Photoresists- Simulated annealing- Speed- Standards- Structural optimization- Ultrasonics- Van der Waals forces- Classical mechanics- Electric energies- Electric power system (EPS)- Generating units- Geometric optimisation- M-S model- Minimum energy- Minimum potential energy- Molecular systems- Optimal solutions- Optimisation- Production costs- Simulated annealing technique- Unit commitment- Unit-commitment problems- Van der Waals energies- Electric generators;English;Article

Being different from the classic On/Off state definition, a model that considers four possible states in order to commit a unit is proposed. The main difference in the classic UC is that in the on-state mode, the unit can be committed to a maximum or minimum power according to its technical generation limits, but it can be also committed without giving power to the system in synchronism (banking state). Therefore, the unit commitment problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimisation problem with four variables. A more complete and necessary state definition is considered according to the electric energy non-regulated market's characteristics and particularly because of the Chilean energy market's characteristics. The new UC problem formulation is then solved using the Simulated Annealing technique and several examples show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed approach models the converters in terms of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) models, which are used to compute gain-scheduled robust gains. The synthesis conditions provide stabilizing controllers with an attenuation level of disturbances in terms of the (Formula presented.) norm. Moreover, the design conditions can also overcome pole locations to comply with physical application restrictions when ensuring transient performance. The validation of the controllers is made via simulation of the classical converters (buck, boost and buck-boost), showing that the proposed method is a viable and generalized control solution that works for all three converters, with guarantees of closed-loop stability and good performance. © 2022 by the authors.;-;English;Article

Currently, the available building management solutions are expensive and challenging to support small and medium-sized buildings. Unfortunately, not all buildings are intelligent, making it difficult to obtain such data from energy measurement devices and appliances or access such information. The internet of things (IoT) opens new opportunities to support real-time monitoring and control to achieve future smart buildings. This work proposes an IoT platform for remote monitoring and control of smart buildings, which consists of four-layer architecture: power layer, data acquisition layer, communication network layer, and application layer. The proposed platform allows data collection for energy consumption, data storage, and visualization. Various sensor nodes and measurement devices are considered to collect information on energy use from different building spaces. The proposed solution has been designed, implemented, and tested on a university campus considering three scenarios: an office, a classroom, and a laboratory.

This work proposes a new controller structure and tuning that we call Generalized Predictive PI (GPPI) controller which provides greater design flexibility than PI and PPI strategies. To realize a fair comparison, the design and tuning rules for discrete PI and PPI controllers were developed using optimal arguments based on the root-locus, for critically damped response before a step change in the reference. Experimental results, using industrial equipment, have illustrated the tuning methodology and the performance of the proposed controller under real conditions. Flow and water level process in a laboratory flume were considered. For these processes, First Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD) models are used. The GPPI control results are encouraging, reducing the settling time plus a very small overshoot before step change in the reference regarding the PI and PPI strategies, up to 41.03% for the flow control loop and up to 54.21% for the level control loop. The discrete analysis of the strategies in the Z plane was performed, allowing for a direct translation to recursive equations that can then be programmed into a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), other industrial controllers such as Distributed Control Systems (DSC), or microcontrollers, such as Arduino, Raspberry or FPGA. This is an important result, since it demonstrates that the increased complexity of the proposed controller does not hamper its implementation in industrial controller systems.

The channel SNR can be connected with most communication issues such as channel input power, additive channel noise, and quantization noise. Recently, a power analysis has also been used to characterize for every instant the effect of packet losses and channel fading. Here, we propose an equivalent average channel model that preserves the first and second moments of a fading channel output in steady state. The proposed equivalency is stated initially in an open loop, and then, with the assumption of a plant model with a relative degree greater or equal to one, extended to the closed-loop feedback allowing a stationary SNR analysis. As a result, we can compute the fading channel SNR for closed-loop stabilizability limitation, and then consider the presence of disturbance and setpoint signals. © 1963-2012 IEEE.;Additives- Fading channels- Feedback- Packet loss- Quantization (signal)- Channel bandwidth- Closed-loop feedback- Explicit communication- Fading channel models- Quantization noise- Relative degrees- Stationary signal- Transmission rates- Signal to noise ratio;English;Article

The controllers are applied to four plants in simulation on a network control system (NCS), three of the plants are FOPTD plants with different self-regulation indices and one corresponds to a higher order non-minimum phase plant. The tests carried out considered fixed and variable delays in a known range for the communication network. The design of the controllers considers a certain degree of robustness using a strategy based on the Nyquist criterion in discrete time. The results show that GPPI has better performance than PPI and PI for FOPTD plants when their delay is greater than their time constant and for the case of the higher order system. The improvement is attributed to the fact that GPPI combines the prediction characteristics of PPI with the smoother transient characteristics of PI, which implies a better behavior in the presence of delay uncertainty. © 2021 IEEE.;Automation- Delay control systems- Process control- Robustness (control systems)- Time delay- Timing circuits- Degree of robustness- Delay uncertainties- Higher-order systems- Integrated absolute errors- Network control systems- Network time delay- Non-minimum phase plants- Transient characteristic- Controllers;English;Conference Paper

However, the non-linear and turbulent nature of the flame, high dimensionality of the spectral data, and the overlap between continuous and discontinuous spectral emissions requires the use of complex method to obtain valuable information for combustion closed loop-control and optimization. This work analyzes the spectral emission of the flame emitted by LPG flames to compute high resolution spectra combining the Maloney-Wandell spectral recovery method and field information of flame images with low spectral resolution. Then, we obtain different variables such as the flame temperature (in K) and local radiance (in μW=cm2), performing a dynamic, spectral and spatial combustion diagnostics. © 2021 IEEE.;Automation- Closed loop control systems- Process control- Spectrum analysis- Combustion closed loop controls- Combustion diagnostics- Combustion pro-cess- Flame temperatures- High dimensionality- High-resolution spectra- Spectral estimation techniques- Spectral recoveries- Combustion;Spanish;Conference Paper

This situation calls for maximizing the efficiency of these types of processes, as well as reducing the contaminants produced. Extremum seeking control (ESC) has the potential to achieve the efficiency required. Here we identify a ladle furnace process using optical variables (OV). We test the options of a Hammerstein or Hammerstein-Wiener plant structures. We then propose an ESC design for the identified nonlinear plant model and simulate its operation. Finally, motivated by a future implementation of the designed ESC over a network, we analyze through simulations three communication networks features: the variance of a communication channel additive noise, the variance of a communication channel gain, and the probability of packet-dropouts. © 2020 Argentine Association of Automatic Control (AADECA).;Automation- Communication channels (information theory)- Control theory- Efficiency- Process control- Extremum seeking control- Flame temperatures- Industrial activities- Ladle furnaces- Non-renewable- Nonlinear plant- Packet dropouts- Plant structures- Additive noise;English;Conference Paper

We characterize the stability of the closed-loop by means of the channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We consider first the case of stable SITO models and propose a design for closed-loop stability that achieves the user desired channel SNR level. We then extend the result to include performance as tracking of constant setpoints. We consider second the case of unstable SITO models for which we find an infimal channel SNR level for stability. Below this value no stability is possible, above this value stability is achieved. We then extend the channel SNR result for unstable SITO plant models to include the same closed-loop performance, stated as stability and tracking of constant setpoints. In this case performance is achieved by designing a complementary sensitivity that satisfies the interpolation conditions needed to avoid the cancellation by the controller of any unstable poles in the plant model. We illustrate the obtained results with examples offering insight into the interplay of the different elements of these same results. © 2020 IEEE.;Continuous time systems- Controllers- Linear control systems- Stability- White noise- Additive white noise channels- Channel signals- Closed loop stability- Closed-loop performance- Interpolation condition- Linear time-invariant system- Stability and tracking- Wireless communications- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

An open channel flow, or also called micro-canal is used to study river floods, scour around coast structures and bridge piers scour. The need for multiple measurement water speed points, in such a way that specific sections of the micro-canal could be controlled, motivated this research. However, the acquisition of high-end speed sensors involves high economic costs being difficult to implement. As a solution, we designed and implemented a micro-velocimeter (MSV) whose operation principle is based on the operation of a small D.C. motor in generator mode. The D.C. generator shaft is turned by a small propeller, which rotates according to the water speed inside the micro-canal. The prototype was designed using AUTOCAD software, simulated by SolidWorks software and built by 3D printing. For the implementation, the MSV was calibrated using an available Acoustic-Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The MSV is a good alternative for realizing multi-point measurements along of a micro-canal or with a matrix arranged in a specific section or both, in a simple and economical form. © 2019 IEEE.;3D printers- Flow measurement- Flow of fluids- Fluid Power- Hydraulic structures- Microsensors- Power generation- Scour- Shore protection- Software prototyping- Velocity measurement- Acoustic Doppler velocimeter- AutoCAD software- Dynamic condition- Hydraulic engineering- Linear approximations- Multiple measurements- Open channels- Solidworks software- Open channel flow;English;Conference Paper

The standard setup controls the flame behavior by measuring the composition of the residual gases discharged to the atmosphere. However, such a solution involves an unavoidable transport delay due to the distance between the flame and the measurement sample, in addition to intrinsic delay in the sensor. In this work, we propose the optically monitoring of the combustion inferring the state of the process by the inclusion of a spectrometer to calculates a novel set of optical variables. Such approach provides an improvement in the monitoring and control of the process by calculating an accurate estimation of the energy efficiency by measuring the flame temperature Tf, the total radiation Radt proportional to the heat transfer- or by measuring the radicals ratio C2*/CH*.

A main issue in the realm of hydraulic research deals with the similitude of conditions typically achieved at the laboratory scale with those occurring in real rivers. In this context, the generation of hydrographs in a laboratory flume, having real-like shapes is of crucial importance for research and technologies related to the design of waterworks.This paper approaches the problem of generation of hydrographs in a laboratory flume, reproducing and controlling a desired flow and level curve on time.A hydrograph was used as a reference signal for the controllers. A model of the system, a structure of two inputs and two outputs (TITO) was proposed, whose parameters were obtained by means of a PRBS signal designed according to the frequency range of the hydrograph, with which it was possible to replicate the dynamic characteristics of interest at a point of operation.Given the non-linearity of the system, a robust decentralized predictive proportional integral control (PPI) strategy is proposed, using two SISO controllers. The selection of input pairs was made by RGA, a decoupler stage with a delta adjustment parameter was implemented, PPI decentralized controllers were designed and implemented by means of lambda tunning and in a similar way PI controllers as a benchmark.Finally, the results of using PI or PPI controllers, with or without uncoupler, are presented. Which were able to reproduce the hydrographs, however it is determined that the PPI controller with decoupler presents a greater decrease of the ERMS and a lower control effort for the tracking of variable references in a non-linear plant, i.e.: Replicating a real-like shape of an hydrograph in the laboratory flume similar to that occuring in a river. © 2018 IEEE.;Automation- Decentralized control- Delay control systems- Hydraulics- Industry 4.0- Laboratories- Open channel flow- Process control- Programmable logic controllers- Proportional control systems- Rivers- Three term control systems- Time delay- Two term control systems- Discrete systems- Hydrographs- Open channels- PID controllers- PPI controllers- Controllers;English;Conference Paper

A distributed perspective is commonly preferred to design controllers in each mobile user in the network for power allocation. The round-trip delay is a characteristic feature of wireless networks, and it was considered a known quantity in previous works. In this paper, we do not follow this assumption and propose the design of the power controller only with the information of upper and lower bounds on the round-trip delay as functions of a frequency gain. In a second stage, we relate the proposed robust design to common performance indicators, such as the step response overshoot. The proposed design rules can be applied to design a suitable robust controller for power control in a wireless network subject to interference. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Controllers- Multiple access interference- Quality control- Quality of service- Signal to noise ratio- Wireless networks- Design controllers- Multiple access network- Networked controls- Performance indicators- Power allocations- Power controllers- Robust controllers- Upper and lower bounds- Power control;English;Article

In this study, the authors study these type of limitations subject to model uncertainties, either from the plant model or the channel model. They consider the discrete-time setting, motivated first by the fact that some form of discretisation is nowadays always required when implementing a feedback control loop solution, and second by the fact that communication channel models are more naturally represented in discrete time.

The LTI modelling approach for real, usually nonlinear, processes compromises accuracy versus complexity of the resulting model. This in turn introduces a gap between the proposed model and the real process, which is known as the model uncertainty. In this paper we then study SNR limitations by considering the continuous-time scenario and the case of an additive coloured Gaussian noise (ACGN) channel with bandwidth limitation, for which we then quantify the infimal SNR subject to the simultaneous presence of plant, channel and noise model uncertainties. We observe, for the special case of memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, that the obtained SNR limitation subject to plant model uncertainty can be redefined as a channel capacity limitation for stabilization. © 2019 ISA;Additives- Bandwidth- Continuous time systems- Control system analysis- Feedback control- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Linear control systems- Networked control systems- Robust control- Uncertainty analysis- White noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Communication channel modeling- Feedback control loops- Fundamental constraints- Fundamental limitations- Model uncertainties- Robust analysis- Robust stability analysis- Signal to noise ratio- article- feedback system- signal noise ratio- uncertainty;English;Article

We treat both cases, fading channel bandwidth limitation and channel additive noise coloring, in a regulation setting (that is with zero reference).

Using a non-linear model identified through optical instrumentation, it is proposed a linear model around an operating condition. To ensure robustness with respect to variations on the operation condition and to deal with external disturbances, a state-space linear representation is further developed, introducing uncertain parameters and exogenous inputs affecting the plant (as non-laminar air flow), giving rise to a poly topic uncertain linear system. Finally, it is proposed a reduced-order H∞ output-feedback control law for the resulting uncertain system, capable to assure closed-loop robust stability and performance in the whole uncertain domain.

For the latter, it has been confirmed early on that the usual culprits increase the minimal SNR for stability, such as unstable plant poles, non-minimum phase (NMP) zeros, time delay, together with new ones such as communication channel bandwidth and colored transmission noise. In this letter we specifically propose two approaches to completely avoid the effect of NMP zeros on the minimal SNR for stability in discrete-time. The first approach stems from the observation that the controller that achieves the minimal SNR for a minimum phase plant in discrete-time, has all its zeros located outside the unit circle (NMP zeros). Such observation allow then to characterize this set of NMP zeros as candidate NMP zeros of alternative plant models with the same unstable poles, which in turn will not increase the minimal SNR for stability above the expression imposed only by the plant unstable poles. Our second approach extends the set of possible NMP zeros that do not increase the SNR limitation to any location, by proposing the synthesis of a two-degree of freedom linear time invariant controller solution that achieves the minimal SNR for stability imposed only by the plant unstable poles. © 2017 IEEE.;Controllers- Degrees of freedom (mechanics)- Delay control systems- Linear control systems- Linear systems- Networked control systems- Poles- Stability- Channel transmission- Fundamental limitations- Linear time invariant controller- Non-minimum phase zero- Optimal controls- Stability results- Transmission noise- Two-degree of freedom- Signal to noise ratio;English;Article

One of the research topics that have arisen from the consideration of NCSs is that of the minimum data rate required to stabilize a given LTI plant. Data-rate limitations may be expressed in the form of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. Existing results have characterized minimum data rates required for stabilization of continuous-time as well as discrete-time systems. However, the effect of sampled-data hold functions on the minimum data rate required for stabilization of a continuous-time system with a discrete-time controller has not yet received sufficient attention. In this paper, we show that, as far as SNR-constrained control is concerned, the use of zero-order hold may be preferable to first-order hold on first- or second-order plants with delay. We thus provide a result on the effect of sampled-data hold functions when the sampling period is given. As a second contribution, we analyze the effect of employing an approximate discrete-time representation on minimum data rates for stabilization. © 2018 AACC.;-;English;Conference Paper

In recent years it has been shown that there is predictive value for hydraulics in studying and analyzing these phenomena at a reduced scale. For this reason the microscale experimental canal was build at the Hydraulics Laboratory at the Universidad of Concepción, with a second copy for control purposes at the Control Systems Laboratory (LCS). The partial differential equations that govern the process are unnecessarily complex for control purposes. Known literature offers the alternative of a third order linear system, capturing the canal standing wave with a second order system together with an integrator to account for the mass accumulation. However, such a proposal, even when slowing the control to discard the standing wave dynamics is only valid for long canals. The microscale experimental canal does not satisfies that assumption, therefore we propose and adjust a first order structure to the process, which proves adequate for any given operating point selection. Nevertheless, the main three parameters of the plant model (gain, time constant and time delay) vary with the operating point. As a preliminary control approach we consider a plant model selection for a specific operating point as the nominal plant and adjust a PI control using the reaction curve method of Ziegler-Nichols. We compare the previous PI tuning with a predictive PI λ tuning to achieve robustness, and thus better deal (in this preliminary control approach) with the inherent variability of the plant model parameters. © 2018;Bridges- Canals- Elastic waves- Hydraulic structures- Hydraulics- Linear systems- Programmable logic controllers- Three term control systems- Time delay- Civil infrastructures- Control systems laboratory- Discrete systems- Hydrographs- Open channels- PID controllers- Second-order systemss- Specific operating point- Delay control systems;English;Conference Paper

Both approaches are based on the detection of the Smoke Point Height (SPH), concept used to determine when a flame is in a sooting state. The first approach is based on the detection of morphological changes in the flame, identified through their amplification via the Eulerian Video Magnification algorithm. Results show an effective amplification of the flame geometry, allowing the visualization of variations on the flame tip unable to be detected by the naked human eye and therefore the detection of SPH. The second approach is based on the application of Artificial Intelligence models to classify flame images regarding their sooting propensity, taking advantage of the knowledge acquired from a referential data set. Both approaches provide an accurate classification when compared to the conventional method of LOSA. Furthermore, both approaches show a greater implementation potential in practical combustion devices than the conventional method of LOSA, due to their reduced hardware and technical requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;Classification (of information)- Combustion- Plasma diagnostics- Smoke- Soot- Conventional methods- Image magnification- Line-of-sight attenuations- Morphological changes- Practical combustion- Smoke point- Sooting propensities- Technical requirement- Artificial intelligence;English;Article

In this context, the current common operation setting in combustion processes could be improved by the introduction of passive optical sensors, which can be located close the flame, thus eliminating the inherent transport delay in current setups that only infer the combustion quality by measuring residual gases emissions. However, there is a tradeoff for flame detection between spatial-spectral resolutions, depending on the optical sensor scheme. In this paper, we present the fundamentals to avoid this constraint, obtaining a combined high spectral and spatial resolution measurement suitable for combustion diagnostics and control. The core of this proposal is to use the flame images from a low-spectral resolution charge-coupled device camera, combined with a spectral recovery method. This method is based on the off-line samples measured on the continuous component of flame spectra, providing a set of vector basis to estimate a calibrated flame spectra at each pixel. The results of the spectral recovery process verify the suitability of the method in terms of goodness-of-fit coefficient and root mean square error metrics, enabling hyper-spectral measurements based on the combination of different optical sensors. Then, continuous estimated spectra along the flame are used to calculate the energy transfer released by radiation, useful for combustion diagnostics. © 2001-2012 IEEE.;Calibration- Cameras- CCD cameras- Charge coupled devices- Economic and social effects- Energy efficiency- Energy transfer- Heat radiation- Image resolution- Optical sensors- Optical variables measurement- Plasma diagnostics- Spectral resolution- Spectrum analysis- Combustion diagnostics- Combustion pro-cess- Combustion qualities- Radiation-sensing- Spatial resolution- Spectral Estimation- Spectral measurement- Spectral recoveries- Combustion;English;Article

The three-parameter exponential function is adopted to relate the normalized scour depth Z* with W*. A novel experimental installation able to reproduce any hydrograph with high precision in the laboratory flume is described and used to carry out four series of scour experiments in order to calibrate and validate the proposed relation. The first series consists of experiments with constant discharge until advanced stages of scour. The second and third series of experiments use single flood waves of different shapes and durations, respectively. The fourth series consists of scour experiments caused by more realistic flow hydrographs with multiple peaks. Results show that the relation between W* and Z* is unique and thus W* represents a reliable concept for the prediction of the flood wave scour because it appropriately integrates the effects of the hydrograph properties, duration, peak discharge, and shape, on scour. The proposed relation allows a straightforward prediction of maximum scour depth after a flood wave with high precision. A good agreement between measured and computed scour was observed in all cases. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.;Bridge piers- Bridges- Exponential functions- Piers- Scour- Constant discharge- Different shapes- Experimental installations- High-precision- Multiple-peak- Peak discharge- Scour depth- Three parameters- Floods- bridge- flood wave- flume experiment- hydrograph- pier- scour- sediment transport;English;Article

Multiple-access interference, nonuniform quantization, and finite wordlength representations are all characterized by multiplicative uncertainty models in the forward and feedback paths of closed-loop power allocation strategies. The quality of service (QoS) in the cellular network is evaluated with respect to signal to interference-noise ratio after the estimation process, where the uplink channel (mobile users to base station) is addressed under arbitrary round-trip delays per user. The multiplicative uncertainty terms are modeled by a stochastic framework, where the mean-square small gain theorem is employed to evaluate robust stability. Two inequalities are then derived to check internal stability with respect to the norms of the multiplicative uncertainty terms, and the sensitivity and its complementary transfer functions of the closed-loop system. The distributed power control scheme that maximizes the stability upper bounds is derived that depends on the round-trip delay per user, and whose structure enables simplifying the inequalities to evaluate robust stability. By establishing a numerical relation between the size of the interference and the multiplicative noise, a unique stability bound is derived for closed-loop power allocation. A numerical evaluation was carried out in a code-division multiple-access cellular network with multiple base stations, and under distinct QoS requirements. © 2014 IEEE.;Base stations- Closed loop systems- Code division multiple access- Mobile telecommunication systems- Multicasting- Multiple access interference- Phase noise- Power control- Quality of service- Robust control- Robustness (control systems)- Signal to noise ratio- Stability- Stochastic systems- Uncertain systems- Wireless networks- Cellular network- Distributed power control- Mobile cellular communications- Multiplicative noise- Multiplicative uncertainty- Non-uniform quantization- Power allocation strategies- Signal to interference noise ratios- Quality control;English;Article

In this paper we offer the rules for the design of discrete-time proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for given closed loop bandwidth that quantifies the SNR requirement for the memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel over the feedback path, which is a common used communication channel model. The design is centered on a PID controller structure due to its wide use in the industry.

For the latter, it has been confirmed early on that the usual culprits, unstable plant poles, non-minimum phase (NMP) zeros, time delay, together with new ones such as communication channel bandwidth, increase the infimal SNR for stability. In this work we explore a two-degree of freedom controller configuration to reduce the infimal SNR for stability, eliminating the effect for example of NMP zeros and/or time delay. The two-degree of freedom controller configuration achieves this by modifying the plant model as seen by the communication channel input. The communication channel model is located between the controller and the plant model. In a second stage we include a second communication channel to lift the ideal assumption that, albeit delayed, the controllers could access the plant input without communication noise. We then judge the improvement offered by the proposed two-degree of freedom controller. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).;Communication channels (information theory)- Control equipment- Controllers- Degrees of freedom (mechanics)- Delay control systems- Information theory- Networked control systems- Stability- Time delay- Channel transmission- Communication channel modeling- Communication noise- Fundamental limitations- Non-minimum phase- Signal to noise- Two-degree-of-freedom controller- Unstable plants- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

The water level control application is a practical example where the use of communication hardware is inescapable. Therefore in our study we consider that on occasions the FF loops will be rendered ineffective due to the inability of the related communication channels to transmit at the required times. We consider first the case in which some FF loops are not operational for a long time (static failure configuration) and propose a stability analysis that shows that as long as the original feedback decentralized control is stable the overall configuration, including the possibly failing FF links, will remain stable. We then consider the more challenging case of time-varying faults on these FF loops and their effect on the overall stability of the system and finally the more general case in which the control action can be FF to all upstream controllers, not just the adjacent one. © 2016 IEEE.;Irrigation- Level control- System stability- Water levels- Arbitrary switching- Communication hardware- Control actions- Irrigation channels- Link failures- Overall stabilities- Static failure- Time-delay systems- Decentralized control;English;Conference Paper

Salvador Nava s/n, Mexico- Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad de Concepción, Chile;Transmission power control constitutes a core feature required to achieve a desired quality of service in wireless networks. A practical implementation calls on the intuition of using limited resources, only when are strictly required. Thus, the appeal of an event-triggered scheme arises naturally over more traditional, but less efficient, periodic time-triggered control solutions. Motivated by these ideas, the authors present here a power allocation strategy based on an eventtriggered transmission (ETT) to reduce the feedback signalling in the network. The power allocation under ETT is based on a nominal control that guarantees internal stability and performance. Hence, if the feedback signalling does not change significantly from the previous sample, no feedback transmission is assigned to reduce bandwidth usage. Two schemes are employed to define the ETT while preserving closed-loop stability: a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov argument and a perturbed linear system approach. These two approaches establish a trade-off between complexity and conservativeness. The power allocation under ETT was thoroughly evaluated under two nominal control schemes to establish a relation between performance and feedback reduction. © 2015 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.;Complex networks- Economic and social effects- Linear systems- Quality of service- Wireless networks- Closed loop stability- Control solutions- Event-triggered- Internal stability- Perturbed linear systems- Power allocation strategies- Power allocations- Transmission power control- Quality control;English;Article

This channel model can be located over the control path, between the controller and the plant, or over the feedback path, between the plant and the controller (or over both simultaneously). It has been shown that an important channel parameter for the stabilisability of the control feedback loop is the channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In this work we propose the controller design to satisfy a given user SNR requirement, when a feed-forward controller is also implemented to compensate the presence of a measurable disturbance. We then highlight the resulting trade-off between measurable disturbance rejection requirement and infimal SNR requirement for both, the control path and the feedback path locations. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.;Controllers- Disturbance rejection- Economic and social effects- Feedback- Channel parameter- Channel signals- Classical control- Control feedback- Controller designs- Feed-forward controllers- Networked controls- Stabilisability- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

At first, the admissible SNRs required for system constraints will be discussed and then the limitation will be set out. We demonstrate that this SNR limitation can be reduced by the design of control system with feed-forward control added to feedback loop in downstream and upstream configurations. As a result, the SNR factor can be considered as one of criterion when choosing different locations of controllers compared to those of feedback sensors and controlled actuators, towards satisfying communication constraints. That makes the analysis and design of a networked control systems easier in terms of communication reliability and efficient bandwidth allocation.

It has been previously shown that an important communication channel parameter related to the stabilisability of the control feedback loop is the channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). In this work we propose rules for the controller design for a given closed loop bandwidth that quantify the SNR requirement of a memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel over the feedback path. The design is centered on a PID controller structure due to its simplicity and common use. We also consider reduced plant model complexity (first and second order models) in order to be compatible with the PID controller structure. © 2015 IEEE.;Controllers- Electric control equipment- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Proportional control systems- Three term control systems- White noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Closed-loop bandwidth- Control feedback- Controller designs- Networked controls- PID controller design- Second-order models- Stabilisability- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

These type of fundamental limitations, in the presence of unstable plant poles, are worsened by non-minimum phase zeros (either from the plant or channel model) and plant time delay. In this paper we extend the analysis of such feedback systems by studying the effects of model uncertainties on the infimal SNR required to stabilize the plant. We consider here the additive coloured Gaussian channel (ACGN) model with memory, for which we then obtain the infimal SNR subject to plant, channel and noise model uncertainties. We observe that the infimal channel SNR is increased by these model uncertainties. Furthermore we use the main result to study the effect of channel model time delay. © 2015 IEEE.;Delay control systems- Signal analysis- Time delay- Uncertainty analysis- Communication channel modeling- Constrained channels- Discrete-time case- Feedback systems- Fundamental limitations- Gaussian channels- Model uncertainties- Non-minimum phase zero- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

We study the presence of a channel model in the feedback loop either over the measurement path, between the plant and the controller, or the control path, between the controller and the plant. We start the analysis by considering the memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel model, and follow-up with the additive coloured Gaussian noise (ACGN) channel with memory model. We observe that the standard SNR constrained feedback loop configuration, when tracking step references, will result in an infinite channel SNR. We show that this situation can be ameliorated by extending the feedback loop configuration with an encoder and decoder. The proposed configurations result in a finite SNR that converges back to the infimal SNR for regulation when the amplitude of the reference signal tends to zero. © 2015, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;Controllers- Feedback control- Gaussian noise (electronic)- White noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Channel with memory- Control over networks- Infinite channels- Performance limitations- Reference signals- Reference-tracking- Signaltonoise ratio (SNR)- Signal to noise ratio;English;Article

Salvador Nava s/n, Mexico- Facultad de Ingeniería, Univ. de Concepción, Chile;In this paper, the problem of power allocation in a wireless network is studied with a distributed perspective by taking into account multiple-access interference in the communication channel, non-uniform quantization and floating-point operations. These three effects can be characterized by multiplicative uncertainty models in the forward and feedback paths of a closed-loop power control strategy. The quality of service (QoS) in the wireless data transmission is evaluated with respect to signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR) after the estimation process, where the uplink channel (active users to base station) is addressed by its implications with respect to battery consumption. The multiplicative uncertainty terms are modeled by a stochastic framework, and the mean-square small gain theorem is employed to evaluate robust stability. Two inequalities are then derived to check internal stability with respect to the norms of the multiplicative uncertainty terms, and sensitivity and complementary sensitivity transfer functions of the closed-loop system. As a case study we considered an LQG controller in each active user for power allocation, whose structure allows to derive simplified inequalities to evaluate robust stability. © 2014 American Automatic Control Council.;Multiple access interference- Quality of service- Spurious signal noise- Stochastic control systems- Stochastic systems- Uncertainty analysis- Wireless networks- Distributed control- Distributed Power-Allocation- Floating point operations- Multiplicative uncertainty- Power allocations- Signal to interference-noise ratios- Small gain- Wireless data transmission- Signal interference;English;Conference Paper

Still, there is no assurance that only one source obtained from this method will contain AA, and thus we aim to select the most representative source of AA. The novelty in this paper is the proposal of three parameters to select the most representative source of AA. These parameters are correlation coefficient with lead V1 (CV1), peak factor (PF) and spectral concentration (SC). The first two parameters are introduced as new indicators, addressing features overlooked by the SC even when they are present in AA during AF. For synthesized data, at least two of the three parameters select the same representation of AA in 93.3% of the cases. For real data (218 ECG recordings), we observe that PF presents, in 89.5% of the cases, values between 2 and 4.5 for the selected sources, ensuring a well-defined range of values for AA. The actual values of CV1 and SC were scattered throughout their possible ranges (0-1 for CV1 and 0.08-0.7 for SC), and the correlation coefficient between these variables was found to be ρ = 0.58. We compared our results with three known algorithms: QRST cancellation, principal components analysis (PCA) and ICA-SOBI. The results obtained from this comparison show that our proposed methods to select the best representation of AA in general outperform the three above-mentioned algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Correlation coefficient- Independent component analysis(ICA)- Kurtosis- Principal components analysis- Second order blind identifications- Selection parameters- Algorithms- Blind source separation- Correlation methods- Diseases- Independent component analysis- Power spectral density- Principal component analysis- Electrocardiography- algorithm- article- electrocardiogram- heart atrium fibrillation- heart atrium function- human- independent component analysis- principal component analysis- priority journal- QRS complex- QT interval- recording- Atrial activity- Atrial fibrillation- Blind source separation- Correlation- ECG- Kurtosis- Power spectral density- Selection parameters- Atrial Fibrillation- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Principal Component Analysis- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

In particular, the study of AF types or sub-classes is a very interesting research topic. In this paper we present a preliminary study to find sub-classes of AF from real 12-lead ECG recordings using k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms. We applied blind source separation to an initial set of 218 recordings from which we extracted a subset of 136 atrial activity signals displaying known properties of AF. As features for clustering we proposed the peak frequency mean value (PFM), peak frequency standard deviation (PFSD) and the spectral concentration (SC). We computed the silhouette coefficient to obtain an optimal number of clusters of k=5, and conducted preliminary feature selection to evaluate clustering quality. We observed that the separability increases if we discard SC as a feature. The proposed method is the first stage to a future AF classification method, which combined with specialist advice, should help in the clinical field. © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation- Classification methods- Clinical research- Clustering quality- Ecg measurements- Hierarchical clustering algorithms- Peak frequencies- Spectral concentrations- Blind source separation- Diseases- Electrocardiography- Frequency standards- Clustering algorithms- algorithm- atrial fibrillation- automated pattern recognition- cluster analysis- electrocardiography- heart atrium- human- normal distribution- pathophysiology- procedures- reproducibility- signal processing- Algorithms- Atrial Fibrillation- Cluster Analysis- Electrocardiography- Heart Atria- Humans- Normal Distribution- Pattern Recognition, Automated- Reproducibility of Results- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Conference Paper

In recent years it has been extended to the study of limitations imposed by the consideration of a communication channel in the control loop. Previous results characterised these limitations in terms of a minimal data transmission rate necessary for stabilisation. In this paper a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approach is used to obtain a tight condition for the linear time invariant output feedback stabilisation of a discrete-time, single-input-single- output (SISO) unstable, non-minimum phase (NMP) plant with arbitrary relative degree over an additive Gaussian coloured noise (ACGN) communication channel with memory. The obtained result gives a guideline in estimating the severity of the fundamental SNR limitation imposed by the plant unstable poles, NMP zeros and relative degree as well as the channel NMP zeros, bandwidth, and noise colouring. We then characterise the output feedback sensitivity function for the infimal SNR solution and follow up by quantifying the extra SNR imposed by suboptimal solutions (for example due to plant modelling errors). © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A particular challenge when dealing with water canals (as water channels are called in agriculture) is usually the long distances involved. This force us to explicitly consider the communication hardware involved in the control solution. Thus, we study the effect on performance and stability of the control solution of some features related to communication channels such as: noise, delay, loss of information packets and variable gain. These four features are considered to be the more relevant and with likely the highest impact.

The location of the communication channel is therefore on the measurement path, that is between the plant and the controller, nevertheless similar results can be obtained for the alternative location over the control path. In our first approach the communication channel model itself is selected to be an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We then describe the spectral power density of the channel density as a function of the power spectral density of the channel additive white Gaussian noise and the uniform distributed process model arising from a logarithmic quantization. The infimal channel SNR is then obtained through the definition for the channel input power, together with an interpretation of a bound on the logarithmic quantization relative error as a multiplicative modeling error. In our second approach we extend the proposed analysis to the class of additive colored Gaussian noise (ACGN) channels with memory. The infimal SNR is then obtained again through the definition for the channel input power. Finally, an extension to the case of sampled-data systems is proposed. © 2011 IFAC.;Additive noise- Additives- Communication channels (information theory)- Controllers- Digital communication systems- Feedback control- Gaussian distribution- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Linear control systems- Quantization (signal)- Sampled data control systems- Spectral density- White noise- Additive White Gaussian noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Channels with memory- Colored Gaussian noise- Communication channel modeling- Linear time invariant- Multiplicative model- Spectral power density- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

In a first approach we consider the stabilizing feedback control to be designed for the mean value of the communication channel gain and obtain the infimal channel SNR in closedform when the gain variability is assumed as an equivalent communication channel multiplicative modelling error. In a second approach we still consider the stabilizing feedback control to be designed for the mean value of the communication channel gain, but obtain the infimal channel SNR in closed-form accounting for the stochastic nature of the channel gain variability. © 2011 IFAC.;Additive noise- Communication channels (information theory)- Fading channels- Feedback control- Linear control systems- Stochastic systems- Channel gains- Communication channel modeling- Feedback paths- Linear time invariant plant- Modelling error- Stabilizing feedback controls- Stochastic nature- Variable gain- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

By considering a linear setting we can express the fundamental limitation on stability as a lower bound in closed-form on the ACGN channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Outside the context of networked control, the obtained lower bound can be interpreted as an H2 performance limitation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The main difference with classic control is that we deal with an explicit communication channel model in the feedback control structure. The channel model is modeled as to have limited bandwidth and additive colored Gaussian noise. This allows us to study the interaction between the control and communication goals. We first briefly revisit the assumption behind the present work and formally define the problem at hand. We then review its solution in the form of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) fundamental limitation for stabilizability result. We extend the stabilizability result to include the following performance scenarios: closed-loop arbitrary pole assignment, robustness, set point tracking and the effect of channel input quantization. We finally conclude the present paper by studying the capacity resulting from these performance limitations for the case of a memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. © 2005 IEEE.;Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Channel inputs- Channel model- Closed-loop- Colored Gaussian noise- Communication goals- Explicit communication- Feedback control structures- Fundamental limitations- Limited bandwidth- Memoryless- Performance limitations- Pole assignment- Set-point tracking- Signal to noise- Stabilizability- Feedback control- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Linear systems- White noise- Signal to noise ratio;Spanish;Review

The present paper extends such formulation to discrete-time systems with feedback over memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and additive coloured Gaussian noise (ACGN) channels with memory subject to uniform quantisation of the channel input. By using a uniform distribution formulation for the quantisation error, we derive closed-form expressions for the infimal LTI SNR for stabilisability subject to quantisation error and the channel capacity in the case of the memoryless AWGN channel and an exact expression for the optimal LTI controller that achieves such infimal LTI SNR for stabilisability subject to quantisation error in the case of the ACGN channel with memory. © 2010 AACC.;Additives- Channel capacity- Communication channels (information theory)- Digital control systems- Discrete time control systems- Errors- Feedback control- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Quantization (signal)- White noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Channels with memory- Closed-form expression- Discrete - time systems- Feedback stabilisation- Linear time invariant- Transmission data rate- Uniform distribution- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

For an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a minimum phase plant with m unstable poles pi, i = 1,⋯ ,m (each with multiplicity ni) such result should coincide with ∑i=1m 2niRe {pi}, a result independently developed by other authors. However, this is not obvious and what observed for just one unstable real pole p in our recent previous work, is instead the factor 2p times a sum of alternating binomial coefficients. Here we study the properties of the finite Blaschke product containing the plant unstable poles and then explicitly prove the link between our recent result and the result independently developed by other authors, all for an AWGN channel and a minimum phase unstable plant. As a third contribution in this note, we prove the alternating binomial coefficients identity observed for the first time in our previous work (to the best knowledge of the author). ©2010 IEEE.;Additives- Bandwidth- Gaussian noise (electronic)- Poles- White noise- Additive white Gaussian noise channel- Bandwidth limitation- Binomial coefficients- Binomial coefficients identities- Blaschke product- Control over networks- Stabilisability- Unstable plants- Signal to noise ratio;English;Conference Paper

This paper is aimed at addressing this issue. We first describe a bias-variance trade-off in parameter estimation when sudden changes are considered. We then propose a mechanism to achieve a compromise between the observed bias and variance. A key ingredient of this mechanism is to use an estimator having a variable memory length. ©2009 IEEE.;Economic and social effects- Bias and variance- Bias variance trade off- Commodity prices- Constant parameters- Financial crisis- Memory length- Sudden change- Time varying- Electronic trading;English;Conference Paper

In recent work by R.E.Betz and G.Mirzaeva it was found that the NFO control algorithm has a stability problem in regeneration mode. The authors proposed an augmentation to the basic algorithm in the form of an auxiliary feedback in the angular velocity estimation. This augmentation resulted in improvement of the NFO performance in regeneration, however, limited to relatively small torque magnitudes and slow dynamics in regeneration. It was expected that flexible control of the auxiliary feedback gain and / or application of a PI block in the auxiliary feedback may be beneficial for further performance improvement of the NFO algorithm. This paper develops a full dynamic model of the NFO controlled system and presents results of its linearised stability analysis. Based on the above, it proposes some more advanced versions of the control over the parameters of the auxiliary feedback. The paper further discusses advantages and limitations of the proposed modifications of the NFO algorithm. To support the discussion, it includes results of simulations and experiments obtained for a test induction machine. © 2008 IEEE.;Applications- System stability- A stabilities- Advanced control strategies- Angular velocity estimations- Basic algorithms- Control algorithms- Control strategies- Controlled systems- Feedback gains- Flexible controls- Induction machines- Natural fields- Performance improvements- Pi blocks- Slow dynamics- Stability analyses- Stability improvements- Feedback;English;Conference Paper

Due to the rectangular slot geometry, stator teeth present a trapezoidal geometry with small tooth width close to the shaft, increasing as the diameter becomes larger. This fact introduces an uneven airgap flux distribution if a constant flux source, such as rectangular PM, is utilized to magnetize the machine. As a result, flux density over the stator tooth becomes irregular, inductance parameters are a function of the stator diameter and saliency varies according to machine load. All these effects degrade machine power capability for low and rated load. In this paper, a novel axial flux PM machine with tangential magnetization is presented. An analytic and numerical study is carried out to consider stator tooth geometry and its effect over machine saliency ratio. © 2008 IEEE.;Air-gap fluxes- Axial flux machines- Axial-flux pm machines- Constant power- Constant-flux sources- Flux densities- Machine loads- Machine saliencies- Magnet shapes- Numerical studies- Power capabilities- Radial-flux machines- Rectangular slots- Stator tooth- Trapezoidal geometries- Computational geometry- Dentistry- Permanent magnets- Stators- Machine design;English;Conference Paper

We prove that the infimal SNR constrained LTI solution, when dealing with a scalar unstable plant, does achieve a channel feedback capacity equal to the infimal rate of transmission required for stability.

By extending the concept of server virtualization to the network infrastructure, the allocation of different, independent virtual networks over a single physical network is carried out on demand. A fundamental challenge in network virtualization systems is to choose which physical nodes and links to use for hosting virtual networks in the physical infrastructure, known as the -virtual network allocationa problem. All virtual network allocation proposals on elastic optical networks assume a centralized operation, deploying a single node with access to the network state global information and assigning resources accordingly. However, such configuration might exhibit the inherent problems of centralized systems: survivability and scalability. In this paper, we present a distributed protocol for resource discovery, mapping, and allocation of network virtualization systems. The distributed protocol is generic enough as to be used with different substrate networks. However, in this paper, it has been adapted to work over an elastic optical network infrastructure, where further considerations regarding the spectrum continuity and contiguity constraints must also be taken into account. The distributed protocol is based on the concept of alliances: upon the arrival of a virtual network request, agents located in the physical network nodes compete to form the first alliance able to host the virtual network. Because the first alliances to be formed are also the ones composed by nearby nodes, a good network resource usage is achieved. The feasibility of the distributed protocol was studied by evaluating its ability to successfully establish virtual networks within acceptable time and with low bandwidth consumption from the coordination messages. © 2009-2012 Optica Publishing Group.;Fiber optic networks- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)- Internet protocols- Virtualization- Agent based- Distributed protocols- Elastic optical networks- Enabling technologies- Network infrastructure- Network virtualization- Physical network- Resource discovery- Resources allocation- Virtual networks- Virtual reality;English;Article

This complexity can be reduced by applying the ideas of abstraction from computer science where different equipment is described in the same basic terms. The noise-to-signal ratio can be used as a metric to describe the quality of transmission performance of a signal propagated through a network element and accumulates additively through a sequence of such elements allowing the estimation of end-to-end performance. This study aims to explore the robustness of the noise-to-signal ratio metric in an installed fibre infrastructure. We show that the abstracted noise-to-signal ratio is independent of the observers and their location. We confirm that the abstracted noise-to-signal ratio can reasonably predict the performance of light-paths subsequently set in our network. Having a robust network element abstraction that can be incorporated into routeing engines allows the network management controller to make decisions on the most effective way to use the network resources in terms of the routeing and data coding format. © 2021, The Author(s).;-;English;Article

It relies on modern fiber designs that support the propagation of multiple spatial modes. One of these fibers, the ring-core fiber (RCF), is able to propagate modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), and has been shown to enhance not only classical but also quantum communication systems. Typically, the RCF spatial modes are used as orthogonal transmission channels for data streams that are coupled into the fiber using different free space beams. Free space beams commonly used are Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and perfect vortex (PV) beams. Here, we study the optimal conditions to multiplex information into ring-core fibers in this scheme. We study the beam coupling efficiency using the overlap between free space beams and RCF bound beams and determine which are the most relevant LG beams to be considered and how their coupling efficiency can be maximized by properly adjusting the beam width with respect to the fiber parameters. Our results show that the coupling efficiency depends upon the OAM value and that this can limit the achievable transmission rates in SDM systems. In this regard, we find optimal coupling configurations for LG beams based on the RCF fiber and beam parameters. Further, we study the PV beam that allows for nearly perfect coupling efficiencies for all spatial modes supported by these fibers. PV beams present higher coupling efficiencies than LG beams and negligible dependence on the OAM value, thus offering an attractive solution to multiplex high counts of OAM channels from free space into a ring-core fiber using a single coupling configuration. © 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.;Data streams- Efficiency- Fibers- Gaussian beams- Optical fiber coupling- Quantum communication- Space division multiple access- Attractive solutions- Coupling efficiency- Optimal conditions- Orbital angular momentum- Ring-core optical fiber- Space division multiplexing- Transmission channels- Transmission rates- Optical fiber communication;English;Article

For this purpose, we consider five network configurations, each named with a network configuration identifier (NCI) from 1 to 5, for which the Routing, Modulation Level, and Spectrum Assignment (RMLSA) problem is solved. NCI 1-4 are transparent configurations based on all-EDFA, hybrid Raman/EDFA amplifiers (with different Raman gain ratio Γ R, all-DFRA, and alternating span configuration (EDFA and DFRA). NCI 5 is a translucent configuration based on all-EDFA and 3R regenerators. We model the physical layer for every network configuration to determine the maximum achievable reach of optical signals. Employing simulation, we calculate the blocking probability and the energy consumption of the different network configurations. In terms of blocking, our results show that NCI 2 and 3 offer the lowest blocking probability, with at least 1 and 3 orders of magnitude of difference with respect to NCI 1 and 5 at high and low traffic loads, respectively. In terms of energy consumption, the best performing alternatives are the ones with the worst blocking (NCI 1), while NCI 3 exhibits the highest energy consumption with NCI 2Γ R=0.75 following closely. This situation highlights a clear trade-off between blocking performance and energy cost that must be considered when designing a dynamic EON. Thus, we identify NCI 2 using Γ R=0.25 as a promising alternative to reduce the blocking probability significantly in wide-area dynamic EONs without a prohibitive increase in energy consumption. © 2013 IEEE.;Dynamics- Economic and social effects- Energy utilization- Fiber optic networks- Network layers- Wide area networks- Blocking performance- Blockings- Elastic optical networks- Energy-consumption- Network configuration- Physical layers- Resource assignment- Translucent configuration- Translucents- Transparent configuration- Blocking probability;English;Article

For this purpose, we solve the static Routing, Modulation Level, Spatial Mode, and Spectrum Assignment (RMLSSA) problem using 34 different explainable demand-prioritization strategies. Although previous works have applied heuristics or meta-heuristics to perform demand-prioritization, they have not focused on identifying the best prioritization strategies, their inner operation, and the implications behind their good performance by thorough profiling and impact analysis. We focus on a comprehensive analysis identifying the best explainable strategies to sort network demands in SDM-EON, considering the physical-layer impairments found in optical communications. Also, we show that simply using the common shortest path routing might lead to higher resource requirements. Extensive simulation results show that up to 8.33% capacity savings can be achieved on average by balanced routing, up to a 16.69% capacity savings can be achieved using the best performing demand-prioritization strategy compared to the worst-performing ones, the most used demand-prioritization strategy in the literature (serving demands with higher bandwidth requirements first) is not the best-performing one but the one sorting based on the path lengths, and using double-criteria strategies to break ties is key for a good performance. These results are relevant showing that a good combination of routing and demand-prioritization heuristics impact significantly on network performance. Additionally, they increase the understanding about the inner workings of good heuristics, a valuable knowledge when network settings forbid using more computationally complex approaches. © 2013 IEEE.;Optical communication- Bandwidth requirement- Comprehensive analysis- Elastic optical networks- Extensive simulations- Physical layer impairments- Resource requirements- Shortest path routing- Space division multiplexing- Space division multiple access;English;Article

These devices are especially important on large-scale optical networks, enabling long-distance communications. In this work, we analyze the impact of these devices on the quality of service in wide-area optical networks in terms of blocking probability. To this end, we performed network simulations to obtain the blocking probability of users on diverse scenarios, modifying the number of regeneration devices per node jointly with several parameters such as link distances, bit-error-rate (BER) threshold, and network capacity. We use a physical layer model considering linear and non-linear impairments to compute the maximum reach of each communication for a given bitrate and modulation format for a variety of BER thresholds. The results show the importance of using 3R regeneration in wide-area elastic optical networks (EON). Notwithstanding, a limit was found where adding regenerators per node does not substantially improve the blocking probability. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis must be done considering the cost involved in installing more of these devices. © 2020 IEEE.;Bit error rate- Blocking probability- Cost benefit analysis- Fiber optic networks- Optical signal processing- Probability- Quality of service- Wide area networks- Elastic optical networks- Large-scale optical network- Long distance communication- Modulation formats- Network quality of services- Network simulation- Regeneration devices- Wide-area optical network- Transparent optical networks;English;Conference Paper

Network operators must consider the relationship between modulation format and maximum reach for each connection request due to the accumulation of physical layer impairments in optical fiber links, to guarantee a minimum quality of service (QoS) and quality of transmission (QoT) to all connection requests. In this work, we present a BER-adaptive solution to solve the routing, modulation format, and spectrum assignment (RMLSA) problem for wide-area elastic optical networks. Our main goal is to maximize successful connection requests in wide-area networks while choosing modulation formats with the highest efficiency possible. Consequently, our technique uses an adaptive bit-error-rate (BER) threshold to achieve communication with the best QoT in the most efficient manner, using the strictest BER value and the modulation format with the smallest bandwidth possible. Additionally, the proposed algorithm relies on 3R regeneration devices to enable long-distances communications if transparent communication cannot be achieved. We assessed our method through simulations for various network conditions, such as the number of regenerators per node, traffic load per user, and BER threshold values. In a scenario without regenerators, the BER-Adaptive algorithm performs similarly to the most relaxed fixed BER threshold studied in blocking probability. However, it ensures a higher QoT to most of the connection requests. The proposed algorithm thrives with the use of regenerators, showing the best performance among the studied solutions, enabling long-distance communications with a high QoT and low blocking probability. © 2013 IEEE.;Adaptive algorithms- Bandwidth- Bit error rate- Blocking probability- Fiber optic networks- Light transmission- Modulation- Optical fibers- Optical signal processing- Quality of service- Regenerators- Elastic optical networks- Flexible optical networks- Long distance communication- Optical-fiber links- Physical layer impairments- Quality of transmissions (QoT)- Spectrum assignment- Wide-area optical network- Wide area networks;English;Article

In typical scenarios where line of sight between the communicating parties is not available, it is convenient to use energy-time entangled photons due to intrinsic robustness while propagating over optical fibers. Here we show an energy-time Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality violation with two parties separated by 3.7 km over the deployed optical fiber network belonging to the University of Concepción in Chile. Remarkably, this is the first Bell violation with spatially separated parties that is free of the postselection loophole, which affected all previous in-field long-distance energy-time experiments. Our work takes a further step towards a fiber-based loophole-free Bell test, which is highly desired for secure quantum communication due to the widespread existing telecommunication infrastructure. © 2015 American Physical Society. © 2015 American Physical Society.;Bells- Fibers- Optical fibers- Quantum communication- Quantum cryptography- Bell inequalities- Bell violations- Bell-inequality violations- Clauser horne shimony holts- Entangled photons- Line of Sight- Optical fiber networks- Telecommunication infrastructures- Optical fiber communication;English;Article

The violation of Bell's inequality offers a method for the certification of quantum links without knowing the inner workings of the devices. Energy-time entanglement quantum communication satisfies all these requirements. However, currently there is a fundamental obstacle with the standard configuration adopted: an intrinsic geometrical loophole that can be exploited to break the security of the communication, in addition to other loopholes. Here we show the first experimental Bell violation with energy-time entanglement distributed over 1 km of optical fibres that is free of this geometrical loophole. This is achieved by adopting a new experimental design, and by using an actively stabilized fibre-based long interferometer. Our results represent an important step towards long-distance secure quantum communication in optical fibres. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In addition, the inverter linear V/f control scheme and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm with variable V/f were developed. MPPT algorithm seeks to extract water in a wide range of power input using the maximum amount of wind power available. Experimental trials at different pump pressures were conducted. With a MPPT tracking system with variable V/f, a power value of 1.3 kW was obtained at a speed of 350 rpm and a maximum operating hydraulic head of 50 m. At lower operating heads pressures (between 10 and 40 m), variable V/f control increases the power generated by the PMG compared to the linear V/f control. This increase ranged between 4% and 23% depending on the operating pressure, with an average of 13%, getting close to the maximum electrical power curve of the PMG. The pump was driven at variable frequency reaching a minimum speed of 0.5 times the rated speed. Efficiency of the power converter ranges between 70% and 95% with a power factor between 0.4 and 0.85, depending on the operating pressure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the challenge remains to develop robust detection methods for different species and considering their distinct conditions. In this article, we present a defect segmentation method, initially developed to detect wood knots in Pinus radiata, based on images taken with X-ray computerized tomographies.

This work proposes an automatic segmentation method for images obtained by CT. It proposes the use of active contour with an energy function that weights the image's potential with object information known a priori to segmentation.

Assuming that the disturbances are generated by an exosystem and only the output of the plant is available for measurement, an observer-based event-triggered controller to ensure the robust asymptotic stability and the disturbance rejection in steady-state is proposed. Considering this setup, LMI-based conditions that ensure the perfect asymptotic disturbance rejection are derived and a convex optimization problem is proposed to systematically compute the event-triggering strategy parameters aiming at reducing the control updates. Since the perfect asymptotic rejection of non-constant disturbances degenerates to periodic (i.e. time-triggered) updates of the control signal in steady-state, a practical disturbance rejection mechanism based on a relaxed triggering criterion and a corresponding convex optimization problem is also proposed. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques. © 2021, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.;Asymptotic stability- Convex optimization- Digital control systems- Discrete time control systems- Linear systems- Numerical methods- Uncertain systems- Uncertainty analysis- Convex optimization problems- Discrete - time systems- Discrete time- Discrete time linear systems- Event-triggered controls- Exosystems- Linear uncertain systems- Observer-based- Regulation problems- Steady state- Disturbance rejection;English;Article

Therefore, several pre-treatments have been proposed to reduce the energy requirements of this stage. This work analyzed the effect of a heating pre-treatment on the Bond index. A conventional heating pre-treatment was applied to a Chilean copper ore. The ore was heated to temperatures from 300 to 600◦ C using a conventional furnace, resulting in a reduction of 19% in the Bond work index. Due to the pre-treatment, the mineral cracked in several areas. Microfracture and composition analyses of these areas confirmed that crack generation in the ore is due to the thermal stress produced by the pre-treatment. The fracture analysis explains the reduction in the Bond work index, since crack generation started at similar temperatures to those at which the reduction in the Bond work index was observed. In addition, the analysis also shows that micro-cracks occur between and through different phases, which may have an impact on mineral liberation. These results also show that, under a moderate high temperature, an important reduction in energy consumption can be obtained. © 2022 by the authors.

A key concern of discarded copper production process water is sulfate. In this study we aim to transform sulfate into sulfur in real mining process water. For that, we operate a sequential 2-step membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) system. We coupled a hydrogenotrophic MBfR (H2-MBfR) for sulfate reduction to an oxidizing MBfR (O2-MBfR) for oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur. A key process improvement of the H2-MBfR was online pH control, which led to stable high-rate sulfate removal not limited by biomass accumulation and with H2 supply that was on demand. The H2-MBfR easily adapted to increasing sulfate loads, but the O2-MBfR was difficult to adjust to the varying H2-MBfR outputs, requiring better coupling control. The H2-MBfR achieved high average volumetric sulfate reduction performances of 1.7–3.74 g S/m3-d at 92–97% efficiencies, comparable to current high-rate technologies, but without requiring gas recycling and recompression and by minimizing the H2 off-gassing risk. On the other hand, the O2-MBfR reached average volumetric sulfur production rates of 0.7–2.66 g S/m3-d at efficiencies of 48–78%. The O2-MBfR needs further optimization by automatizing the gas feed, evaluating the controlled removal of excess biomass and S0 particles accumulating in the biofilm, and achieving better coupling control between both reactors. Finally, an economic/sustainability evaluation shows that MBfR technology can benefit from the green production of H2 and O2 at operating costs which compare favorably with membrane filtration, without generating residual streams, and with the recovery of valuable elemental sulfur.

Valuable elements such as Cu, Ag, and Mo increase the price while the presence of As reduces it. The quantification of these elements by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in mineral ores with varied concentrations spanning from ppm to percentage is challenging. Several factors such as matrix effects, signal fluctuations (laser energy fluctuations, plasma instability, sample inhomogeneity), and self-absorption effects can contribute to analytical errors. Although advanced chemometric methods like artificial neural networks (ANN) can account for these limitations, tuning too many parameters may lead to overfitting of the results. Hence, to avoid overfitting, meaningful information should be fed to the model. In this work, a systematic procedure for getting meaningful LIBS spectral data i.e. “judicious data processing” is proposed. It consists of spectra normalization, feature selection and stratified data division. First, the normalization is done by using an internal standard (ISSN) considering emission lines (Al, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Si) of the main components of the matrix. Second, the feature selection is performed by identifying linearly correlated wavelengths (LCW) with the concentration of each target element. Third, stratified data division in the ANN regression is implemented. This approach, involving LIBS-ANN regression, is applied for multi-elemental quantification of valuable (Cu, Ag, Mo) and penalized (As) elements in copper ores. We compared the ANN models, considering features selection by LCW and prior knowledge spectral lines (PKSL), which are usually utilized in the literature. In terms of analytical figures, the root mean square error of predictions (RMSEP) using LCW improved for Cu (1.45% to 1.04%), Ag (8.5 mg·kg−1 to 6.0 mg·kg−1), and As (0.16% to 0.06%), while it remained unchanged for Mo (0.04%). These improvements can be attributed to the decrease of spectral interferences, caused by the selection of the least affected lines and the compensation of signal fluctuations by spectral normalization. © 2021;Atomic emission spectroscopy- Data handling- Electromagnetic fields- Feature extraction- Inductively coupled plasma- Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy- Matrix algebra- Mean square error- Ore analysis- Ores- Plasma diagnostics- Copper concentrates- Copper ore- Data division- Features selection- Geochemical analysis- Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)- Normalisation- Overfitting- Signal fluctuations- Wavelength selection- Neural networks;English;Article

This work proposes a new controller structure and tuning that we call Generalized Predictive PI (GPPI) controller which provides greater design flexibility than PI and PPI strategies. To realize a fair comparison, the design and tuning rules for discrete PI and PPI controllers were developed using optimal arguments based on the root-locus, for critically damped response before a step change in the reference. Experimental results, using industrial equipment, have illustrated the tuning methodology and the performance of the proposed controller under real conditions. Flow and water level process in a laboratory flume were considered. For these processes, First Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD) models are used. The GPPI control results are encouraging, reducing the settling time plus a very small overshoot before step change in the reference regarding the PI and PPI strategies, up to 41.03% for the flow control loop and up to 54.21% for the level control loop. The discrete analysis of the strategies in the Z plane was performed, allowing for a direct translation to recursive equations that can then be programmed into a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), other industrial controllers such as Distributed Control Systems (DSC), or microcontrollers, such as Arduino, Raspberry or FPGA. This is an important result, since it demonstrates that the increased complexity of the proposed controller does not hamper its implementation in industrial controller systems.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to estimate the concentration of minerals in samples from LIBS spectra. These spectra are very high dimensional data, and it is known that only specific wavelengths have information on the atomic and molecular features of the sample under investigation. This work presents a systematic methodology based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for selecting the wavelengths of LIBS spectra as well as the ANN model complexity, by combining prior knowledge and variable selection algorithms. Several variable selection algorithms are compared within the proposed methodology, namely KBest, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization, principal component analysis (PCA), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS). As an illustrative example, the estimation of copper, iron and arsenic concentrations in pelletized mineral samples is performed. A dataset of LIBS emission spectra with 12 287 wavelengths in the range of 185-1049 nm obtained from 131 samples of copper concentrates is used for regression analysis. An ANN is then trained considering the selected reduced wavelength data. The results are satisfactory using LASSO and CARS algorithms along with prior knowledge, showing that the proposed methodology is very effective for selecting wavelengths and model complexity in quantitative analyses based on ANNs and LIBS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.;Atomic emission spectroscopy- Chemical analysis- Clustering algorithms- Coherent scattering- Complex networks- Copper- Copper metallurgy- Copper smelting- Minerals- Regression analysis- Akaike information criterion- Arsenic concentration- Copper concentrates- High dimensional data- Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)- Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators- Systematic methodology- Variable selection algorithms- Neural networks;English;Article

The mineralogical analysis of these concentrates is very important for quality control and monitoring the feed of smelters. The use of spectroscopy provides a means to carry out this analysis by measuring the reflected or emitted spectra when the samples are illuminated by different light sources. Diffuse Reflectance (DRS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) provide key complementary information for identifying and quantifying mineralogical components. Combining the information of these spectra is crucial to perform the measurements at the same spatial domain. This contribution presents the analysis of copper concentrates using a multi-purpose set-up, measuring both spectra at the same spatial position, and the use of data fusion techniques for blending the information. Low and mid-level data fusion strategies are compared in terms of their effectiveness. In this application, the experimental results show that mid-level data fusion provides the best result outperforming the predictions done by the separated information sources. These results indicate that the spectral measurements obtained by LIBS and DRS from the same measuring point with high spatial resolution can be combined for enhancing the mineralogical analysis of copper concentrates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Atomic emission spectroscopy- Blending- Copper- Copper smelting- Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy- Light sources- Quality control- Reflection- Copper concentrates- Copper production- Diffuse reflectance- Intermediate product- Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)- Mineral species- Mineralogical analysis- Production process- Pyro-metallurgical process- Spectra's- Spectrum analysis;English;Article

An expression for the achievable performance in terms of the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) is obtained for the GPPI controller and used to compare with the other controllers.

This work demonstrates the suitability of stand-off LIBS (ST-LIBS) for real time monitoring of the desulfurization of blister copper which is carried out in molten phase. Here sulfur is removed by the formation of SO2 by supplying oxygen in molten phase. Using ST-LIBS the relative emission intensities of Cu(I) at 351.06 nm, O at 777.34 nm and S at 921.29 nm in both molten and gaseous phase were considered simultaneously during the process. This was possible only by the use high energy laser pulse over up to 270 mJ per pulse. In the case of copper, the selection of emission lines was assessed considering non-linear behavior, which is caused by self-absorption. For the first time, real time determination of sulfur in ppm range is reported by ST-LIBS using low sensitive lines from the NIR region. These results were validated with differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) as gold standard method. The analytical information obtained by LIBS can precisely determine the critical end-point of the desulfurization where the removal of sulfur is finished, and copper started to oxidize. © 2021;Absorption spectroscopy- Copper- Copper compounds- Desulfurization- Light absorption- Blister copper- Desulphurization- Desulphurization process- Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)- Molten phasis- Monitoring sensors- Pyro-metallurgical process- Real time monitoring- Stand-off- Stand-off LIBS- Sulfur- copper- glass fiber- nickel- nitrogen- oxygen- sulfur- absorption spectroscopy- Article- bioassay- desulfurization- desulfurization assay- field emission- flow rate- human- laser induced breakdown spectroscopy- molten phase- physical parameters- plasma- blister- laser- spectroscopy- Blister- Copper- Humans- Lasers- Spectrum Analysis- Sulfur;English;Article

LIBS is an analytical laser-based technique, where a pulsed laser is focused on a sample to create a plasma. The optical emission from the plasma can be transferred through open-path optical configuration or via an optical fiber to a spectrometer to receive analytical information in the form of elemental composition. Thus, a relatively long-distance analysis can be performed using LIBS. Several modern experimental arrangements, patents and industrial notes are assessed, and the literature is reviewed. The review includes applications of LIBS to analyze steel, iron, aluminum, copper, slags, metal melts, and other materials. Temperature, pressure, and atmospheric composition are crucial parameters of any melting process. Hence, past studies on molten phases describing these parameters have been discussed. Finally, the review addresses the last technological advances for these types of applications. It also points out the need of development in some fields and some limitations to overcome. In addition, the review highlights the use of modern machine learning and data processing techniques to increase the effectiveness of calibration and quantification approaches. These developments are expected to improve the performance of LIBS systems already implemented at an industrial scale and ease the development of new applications in pyrometallurgical processes to address the stringent market and environmental regulations. © 2021 by the authors.

The controllers are applied to four plants in simulation on a network control system (NCS), three of the plants are FOPTD plants with different self-regulation indices and one corresponds to a higher order non-minimum phase plant. The tests carried out considered fixed and variable delays in a known range for the communication network. The design of the controllers considers a certain degree of robustness using a strategy based on the Nyquist criterion in discrete time. The results show that GPPI has better performance than PPI and PI for FOPTD plants when their delay is greater than their time constant and for the case of the higher order system. The improvement is attributed to the fact that GPPI combines the prediction characteristics of PPI with the smoother transient characteristics of PI, which implies a better behavior in the presence of delay uncertainty. © 2021 IEEE.;Automation- Delay control systems- Process control- Robustness (control systems)- Time delay- Timing circuits- Degree of robustness- Delay uncertainties- Higher-order systems- Integrated absolute errors- Network control systems- Network time delay- Non-minimum phase plants- Transient characteristic- Controllers;English;Conference Paper

In the specific case of copper pyrometallurgy, the situation is particularly challenging to incorporate the Industry 4.0 concept for the optimization of their operations. Currently, only two instruments can be identified at the commercial level: the Noranda pyrometer and the Online Production Control (OPC) system. The iron-making and steelmaking industries, however, present an advanced level of control based on monitoring and sensing networks throughout the entire process. This reality has served as a basis for developing a series of solutions based on radiometric sensors for copper pyrometallurgy. We present two types of sensing concept. The first one is applied to smelting and converting reactors based on the measurements of the radiation of the oxidation of different copper and iron sulfides. The second one considers hyperspectral imaging of molten phases flow during operations. The idea of this proposal is to transfer some commercial sensing technologies already in use in the steelmaking industry. In this article, the fundamentals of the sensor design, proofs of concept, and the initial industrial validations are reviewed. Finally, a discussion on the contribution of this knowledge and development opportunities within the framework of Industry 4.0 are addressed. © 2020 by the authors.

There are in the market many simulation environments for carrying out these tasks. Despite the existence of these advanced tools, there is a need of having more flexible environments that could be easily integrated with other tools such as optimization, advanced data analysis and real-time systems. In this work, the use of SimEvents™ is explored to build basic models of the main components of a haulage system. Using the unique abstraction mechanism of this environment, the main components are programmed as blocks that can be used to configure mining haulage systems. A hypothetical open-pit haulage system is simulated using Arena and the proposed simulation environment. Several simulation scenarios are used to compare the different features of these simulation tools and demonstrate the flexibility of the SimEvents™ models to address different operational scenarios including the integration of dispatching and maintenance operations. In addition, these models, unlike the Arena ones, have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with other Matlab™ toolboxes for optimization and analysis. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

This last feature imposes computational constraints and short prediction horizons are therefore needed. In fact, in many applications an horizon one FCS-MPC controller is used. However, using FCS-MPC with a short prediction horizon in topologies that exhibit non-minimum phase behavior such as active-front-end rectifiers, dc-dc boost converters, and Z-source converters, among others, may lead to control issues. This work studies the origin of these control issues using nonlinear control theory considering a dc-dc boost converter as a case study. It is shown that the difficulty to directly control the converter output voltage using short horizon FCS-MPC is the resulting unstable internal dynamic, as the short horizon FCS-MPC controller acts like an input-output linearizing controller. To solve the problem of the unstable internal dynamic, a short horizon FCS-MPC controller based on input-state linearization is proposed allowing correct operation of the system. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposal. © 1986-2012 IEEE.;Computation theory- Controllers- Linear control systems- Model predictive control- Predictive control systems- Rectifying circuits- Active front end rectifiers- Computational constraints- Conceptual simplicity- DC-DC boost converters- Input output linearizing- Non-minimum phase behavior- Nonlinear control theory- Z-source converters- DC-DC converters;English;Article

For this, two partial power and two interleaving methods are evaluated in terms of efficiency and performance. The selected topology consists of input-parallel-output-parallel interleaved DC/DC converters, which together with the control strategy, allows a high efficiency photovoltaic system, unlike conventional topologies. However, this type of topology is prone to present an unbalanced power distribution between the DC/DC power cells, mainly due to the natural differences between their components. This paper shows the application of a power balancing control strategy for interleaved partial power converters, which guarantees an equitable power distribution, therefore, it enables a correct sizing of the components.

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, Metropolitan Region, Chile- Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas, Concepción, Bío Bío 4070409, Chile;Given that most of the mines in Chile are situated in regions with high solar resources, solar power could play a significant role as an alternative solution to satisfy the electricity demand in the mining industry. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of integrating solar power technology into copper concentrate plants (CCPs). Three commercial technologies (PV, CSP, and hybrid PV-CSP) are considered for integration into four existing CCPs of different sizes and located in different regions. To provide comprehensive analysis, the design, performance and economic assessment of 12 cases are carried and the investment costs are estimated taking into account characteristics of the Chilean market as well as the effect of scale. The performance analysis reveals a strong influence of the degradation rate on the electricity production of solar power plants. The first-year capacity factor of the CSP units is around 68% while it is around 32% for the case of PV units. Due to the degradation in the performance of the components, the lifetime-averaged capacity factor is about 9% lower than that of the first year. The economic assessment indicates that PV is the most suitable technology for integration into the CCPs. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of PV-CCPs ranges from 35.53 to 44.40 USD/MWhe, depending on the size and the location of the plant. The LCOE for the cases of CSP-CCPs and PV-CSP-CCPs ranges from 127.08 to 168.88 USD/MWhe and from 91.89 to 118.91 USD/MWhe, respectively. The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) of the PV-CCPs ranges from 8 to 9%, it discounted pack-back period (DPP) ranges from 5 to 6 years. The DPP PV-CSP-CCPs ranges from and from 15 to 23 years respectively. Overall, the CSP-CCPs are not atractive investments due to high LCOE, longer DPP, and MIRR. However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that its LCOE could be lowered by reducing the investment costs. For instance, a reduction of about 10% in the LCOE is possible if the specific investment costs of the TES is cut to about 10UDS/kWth. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Copper- Copper metallurgy- Copper smelting- Cost benefit analysis- Cost reduction- Degradation- Earnings- Integration- Investments- Sensitivity analysis- Alternative solutions- Commercial technology- Comprehensive analysis- Concentrating solar power- Electricity production- Internal rate of return- Levelized cost of electricities- Solar power technologies- Solar power plants;English;Article

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, 8370451, Chile- Faculty of Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas 1290, Concepción, Chile;Concerns over the environmental influence of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have encouraged researchers to develop alternative power technologies. Among the most promising, environmentally friendly power technologies for large-scale applications are solar power tower plants. The implementation of this technology calls for practical modeling and simulation tools to both size the plant and investigate the scale effect on its economic indices. This paper proposes a methodology to design the main components of solar power tower plants and to estimate the specific investment costs and the economic indices. The design approach used in this study was successfully validated through a comparison with the design data of two operational commercial power tower plants- namely, Gemasolar (medium-scale plant of 19.9 MWe ) and Crescent Dunes (large-scale plant of 110 MWe ). The average uncertainty in the design of a fully operational power tower plant is 8.75%. A cost estimation showed the strong influence of the size of the plant on the investment costs, as well as on the economic indices, including payback period, internal rate of return, total life charge costs, and levelized cost of electricity. As an illustrative example, the methodology was applied to design six solar power tower plants in the range of 10–100 MWe for integration into mining processes in Chile. The results show that the levelized cost of electricity decreases from 156 USD/MWhe for the case of a 10-MWe plant to 131 USD/MWhe for the case of a 100-MWe plant. The internal rate of return of plants included in the analyses ranges from 0.77% (for the 10-MWe case) to 2.37% (for 100-MWe case). Consequently, the simple payback ranges from 16 years (for the 100-MWe case) to 19 years (for the 10-MWe case). The sensitivity analysis shows that the size of the solar receiver heavily depends on the allowable heat flux. The degradation rate and the discount rate have a strong influence on economic indices. In addition, both the operation and the deprecation period, as well as the price of electricity, have a crucial impact on the viability of a solar power tower plant. The proposed methodology has great potential to provide key information for prospective analyses for the implementation of power tower technologies to satisfy clean energy needs under a wide range of conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

The results show that turbidity-independent models (sets A, B and C) are not suitable for the modeling of solar direct irradiance. Besides, turbidity-dependent models (sets D, E, F, and G) perform so much better than turbidity-independent models. However, few models perform well under all conditions. Among 11 AOD-dependent models, only six models are considered “good”. The performance of the models of set F decreases with the increase of β (aerosols’ turbidity), while those belonging set G perform adequately even at high turbidity. Overall, the accuracy of most models is sensitive to solar elevation and atmospheric turbidity. Besides, some models are accurate only under limited conditions. As a result of this detailed investigation, six high-performance models can be recommended: ESRA, Ineichen, Yang, MLWT1, REST and MWLT2. © 2019;Quality control- Solar radiation- Turbidity- Accuracy- Atmospheric turbidity- Direct normal irradiances- Solar radiation model- Solar resource assessments- Climate models- accuracy assessment- clear sky- irradiance- numerical model- radiometric survey- solar power- solar radiation- turbidity- Atacama Desert- Chile;English;Retracted

Tupper 2007 Piso 4, Santiago, Metropolitan Region, Chile- Faculty of Engineering, University of Concepcion, Víctor Lamas 1290, Concepción, Bío Bío, Chile;The design and cost estimation of solar thermal systems for integration to industrial processes require the analysis of multiple alternatives in terms of solar collector technology, configurations, and equipment sizes. This paper presents a practical approach to design and to estimate the costs of the integration of solar thermal energy to the mining industry. The approach is applied to integrate a solar thermal system to a copper mining process, which is located in Calama, Chile. The proposed solar thermal system consists of a parabolic trough solar field integrating a thermal energy storage to produce hot air for drying copper concentrate. The analysis indicates a capital cost of 3813 USD/kWth. The most important investments are the solar field (44%) and the energy storage system (42%). The real (nominal) levelized cost of heat is 5.21 (6.03) cent USD/kWth, which is relatively lower than those obtained in Europe. © 2019. The Authors.

Based on the Lyapunov theory, LMI-based conditions for the guarantee of perfect reference tracking/disturbance rejection under the proposed event-trigger strategy are derived. Furthermore, to avoid that the ETC strategy degenerates to a periodic one (in the case of non constant signals), a practical tracking/rejection solution considering a trade-off between the reduction of the control updates and the tolerance to a small error in steady state is proposed. The conditions are then casted in LMI-based optimization problems to compute the triggering functions aiming at reducing the control updates while ensuring the perfect or the practical tracking.

The proposed strategy uses the complex representation of the switching states and splits them choosing the best one without using an iterative loop. The resulting algorithm, in terms of the dynamic and static response, performs like the traditional Finite Set Model Predictive Control (FS-MPC). However, the proposed scheme is easy to implement, it does not need to tune parameters nor need a cost function and nor require iterating all the possible states to choose the best. Over the abovementioned advantages, it has the capability to operate the photovoltaic module at the maximum power point (MPP) and the ability to impose a sinusoidal current at the grid side with a unitary displacement power factor. Preliminary results are presented to validate the proposed control method. © 2020 IEEE.;Cost functions- Industrial electronics- Iterative methods- Photovoltaic cells- Predictive control systems- Displacement power factor- Dynamic and static response- Hybrid control scheme- Maximum power point- Photovoltaic applications- Photovoltaic modules- Photovoltaic systems- Sinusoidal currents- Model predictive control;English;Conference Paper

These sensors measure the spectral responses at a large number of wavelengths correlated with the process variables of interest. However the spectral measurement can also be affected by external factors such as changes in temperature. In order to estimate the process variables from the acquired spectrum it is necessary the use multivariate calibration methods. Additive effects of external factors can be easily compensated by standard calibration methods, but multiplicative effects require complex off-line calibration procedures. This work, shows that this problem can be modeled by a non-linear state space equation. In addition, it also proposes an on-line calibration method based on a state observer for compensating multiplicative effects and at the same time estimating the desired process variable from the spectrum. The convergence of the observer requires a uniform observability condition to be satisfied. Simulation results obtained by using a spectral sensor for monitoring a mixing process under time-varying temperature show the main features and potential of the proposed approach. More complex spectral models for modeling the effect of temperature and other variables can be considered and included in the proposed framework. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The paper is retracted because of: 1. A preliminary release of Meteorological Radiation Model (MRM) has been used rather than the current version (6.1), which affects the results presented in Table 1. Some inputs required by the MRM code are not used. Therefore, the categorization of the models shown in Table 1 is not correct. 2. The use of 1-min radiation values is uncertain in the sense that short time intervals may contain peculiar circumstances, such as, reflection of radiation by clouds, and short passage of Cumulus clouds. If such measurements are not correctly filtered, they may not be well compared to the simulations obtained with a clear-sky radiation model, which is insensitive to such a dynamic atmospheric occurrence. In this regard, the method selected to detect cloud artifacts is not satisfactory. 3. There is a mistake with the maximum value of P registered at the altitude of z = 965 m amsl (i.e., P = 1046 hPa), which is an extremely high pressure. As the authors do not mention any quality-control procedure for the meteorological data, this creates ambiguities about their precision. Furthermore, filtering the meteorological data by their 5-min averages would avoid extreme values. 4. All solar radiation quality-control tests take into account the pyranometers’ cosine-effect problem. Therefore, radiation values of solar altitudes lower than 5° (or even 6° or 10° according to the criterion set) must be excluded. The present study accepted all DNI values from sunrise to sunset. This verifies the erroneous behavior of the models in Figs. 3 and 4 for solar altitudes close to or less than 10°. 5. In Table 3, the minimum value of the Linke turbidity coefficient, TL, estimated during the experimental period, is indicated as 0.79—a physical impossibility since, by definition, TL must be larger than 1. 6. In Table 3, the minimum value of both β and AOD is 0, which is an abstraction because it would mean a total absence of aerosols. 7. In Table 4, model performance results are deemed “excellent” if their coefficient of determination (R2) is <2.5%, which is unsubstantiated. 8. In Table 5, many R2 values are found >100%, which is impossible. 9. The main problem of the paper is that the method used to obtain the input data to the models is circular, i.e., directly derived from the very same irradiance data then used to “validate” the models' irradiance predictions. This invalidates the method and the results presented. These affect the reliability of the analysis presented in the paper, so the paper is retracted. © 2020;-;English;Erratum

The reliance on fossil fuel and gas generated electricity is a significant proportion of current mining operational costs and the prevalence of diesel fuel usage is a significant health and safety concern. The use of electric vehicles and machinery combined with partial or stand-alone renewable energy powered microgrids provides a pathway to more efficient, sustainable and safer mining operations, both for underground mining and open-pit mining. Electrification also presents an opportunity to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as autonomous vehicles, communications networks and data analysis for safety and higher efficiency. Digitalization and automation is also the solution to reduce operational costs in areas related with concentration and transport. The transition to an electric mining future is complex and will require substantial investment in infrastructure, technologies, and hardware as well as collaboration between the mine operators and service industries, research organisations and regional, State and Federal governments, and newly skilled workforce in Australia. This paper provides an overview of the status of mine electrification and highlights the potential research directions, which aimed to help shape the resource industries transition to an electric and renewables mining future. © 2020 IEEE;Cost reduction- Electric power transmission networks- Electric utilities- Fossil fuels- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)- Internet of things- Investments- Machinery- Microgrids- Service industry- Smart power grids- Underground mine transportation- Communications networks- Federal governments- Internet of Things (IOT)- Potential researches- Renewable energies- Skilled workforces- Substantial investments- Underground mining- Open pit mining;English;Conference Paper

Then, an inter-comparison between all the selected models are carried out to establish degree of agreement between the models. High-resolution solar radiation data, at one-minute intervals, taken from Plataforma Solar del Desierto de Atacama, is used in this investigation. Results shows that seven models (among 11 models) generally agree well, with a maximum difference of 0.004 in the estimation of the Angstrom coefficient.

To determine the atmospheric turbidity and solar irradiance, scientists commonly refer to three methods, which are based on ground and/or space instruments. The drawback of these methods is that they do not provide any information about the turbidity of the atmosphere and the intensity of solar irradiance when the instruments are not available. The present study provides an alternative method to quantify the atmospheric turbidity and solar irradiance from measured data of ambient temperature and relative humidity. To overcome the complexity associated with the existing techniques, simple expressions have been proposed to estimate Precipitable Water (PW), Linke's turbidity factor (TL) and aerosols transparency coefficient (k). High quality radiometric databases, recorded at PSDA station, located in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are used to validate the new method. The proposed PW's expression has shown a Mean Bias Error (MBE) of 4.19%, better than the one used in REST2v5 solar radiation code, which has a MBE of 8.06%. Besides, the new method introduced herein, estimates TL with a MBE of 1.31%, which corresponds to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.64% and 10.22% respectively. The method has successively predicted the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) with a high accuracy. Indeed, the average deviation (MBE) from the measured DNI is less than 1%, which corresponds to a MAE and RMSE of 3.29% and 5.21% respectively. The careful analysis of the results reveals strong influence of the atmospheric turbidity's uncertainty on the prediction uncertainty of DNI. © 2019;Aerosols- Energy conservation- Errors- Global warming- Mean square error- Solar energy- Solar radiation- Temperature- Turbidity- Uncertainty analysis- Atacama desert , Chile- Atmospheric turbidity- Direct normal irradiances- Linke's turbidity factor- Prediction uncertainty- Root mean square errors- Solar irradiances- Temperature and relative humidity- Atmospheric humidity;English;Article

In particular, visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum have offered an inexpensive way to obtain information about their mineralogical composition. In this work, near-infrared hyperspectral reflective images of several mineral samples are obtained and analyzed. The average reflective spectrum of Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), Pyrite (FeS2), Chalcocite (Cu2S), Covellite (CuS), and Slag (FeO-SiO2) packed into pellets were obtained using a near-infrared hyperspectral camera. In order to analyze copper concentrates, a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier was trained to identify its main components. A 10 fold cross validation approach was used to certify the validity of the classifier. The trained classifier provided the mineralogical spatial distribution of the different components in a concentrate sample. An automatic system controlling all the acquisition and image processing stages provides analysis of the concentrate samples. Further work is underway to include additional minerals and to improve implementation issues such as signal filtering.

The stability of the controller is proved through the use of a Lyapunov-like candidate function. Finally, the practical usefulness of the method is illustrated by some closed-loop simulations of the experimentally verified model of the extrusion process. The interconnection of the moving interface is performed under the assumption of variable viscosity along the extruder and a finite-volume scheme is used for the discretisation of the dynamic model. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Controllers- Energy-based control- Hyperbolic system- Moving interface- Non-linear modelling- PDEs- Extrusion;English;Article

The development of models to describe these processes is very important for their analysis, optimization and operation. The framework of irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems has proven to be an important tool to analyze and integrate thermal models with models of different domains. This work discusses the modeling of non-isothermal electrochemical processes as irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems. An irreversible port-Hamiltonian model based on the internal energy function is derived for a simple but general example. The irreversible model is obtained from the molar and charge balance equations combined with the entropy balance equation. The resulting model can be interpreted as a thermodynamic system and aspects such as entropy production, thermodynamic driving forces and intensive/extensive variables are encoded in the representation. An electrochemical process with two simultaneous reactions is considered to illustrate the approach.

These systems are suitable for hose applications where there is lack of space and both types of energy are needed. Both electric and thermal power obtained from the PV/T systems, can be optimized through proper control strategies. In this work, three optimizing control strategies are compared. The first strategy uses a model to calculate the gradient of the generated power, the second is based on the perturbation-averaging extremum seeking approach, and the third is based on a time-varying extremum seeking control. Lyapunov theory is used in all the cases for convergence analysis. Simulation results show that all three strategies reach their objectives. The main differences were in terms of the implementation complexity, signals waveforms and the convergence times. Experimental evaluation is part of the current research. © 2018 IEEE.;Control theory- Energy conversion- Control strategies- Convergence analysis- Experimental evaluation- Extremum seeking control- Implementation complexity- Lyapunov theories- Optimizing control- Photovoltaic/thermal- Electric power system control;English;Conference Paper

This mainly due to the high solar irradiation levels available and governmental backing of the technology. However, this growth is predominantly due to large-scale utility size power plants, being distributed generation on residential and commercial installations only a small fraction of it. This reduced growth on small scale PV systems is primarily attributed to the lack of qualified designers and installers, and the low awareness among the general public on the benefits of solar generation. To help tackle this problem, the development of an integrated e-learning platform is under way, which will provide differentiated courses for each objective group. This paper describes the course structure and its implementation using Moodle as the core of the learning managing system. © 2018 IEEE.;Curricula- Energy conversion- Photovoltaic cells- Small power plants- Solar power generation- Commercial installation- Community outreach- Course structure- E-learning platforms- Integrated e-learning- Open educational resources- Photovoltaic technology- Solar irradiation- E-learning;English;Conference Paper

Since many mineral processing plants are located in desert regions with high solar radiation levels, companies are looking at solar energy, as a renewable energy source, to supply their energy needs. This work describes two examples of Solar Energy Systems (SES) integration into mineral processing plants. They provide an overview of the current challenges and deliver some lights about opportunities for further developments. The first example describes a hybridization strategy- i.e. a combination of different energy resources, to meet the energy demand of a large water pumping station. The second example illustrates an application where a load shifting strategies is designed to match the cyclic behavior of the energy sources. The main conclusion of this work, is that given the characteristics of solar energy systems and the operation of current mineral processing plants, optimization and control are key enabling techniques to make an efficient use of this renewable energy source. Further work is underway to look at the development of case study for a Chilean mineral processing plants.

One of the research topics that have arisen from the consideration of NCSs is that of the minimum data rate required to stabilize a given LTI plant. Data-rate limitations may be expressed in the form of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. Existing results have characterized minimum data rates required for stabilization of continuous-time as well as discrete-time systems. However, the effect of sampled-data hold functions on the minimum data rate required for stabilization of a continuous-time system with a discrete-time controller has not yet received sufficient attention. In this paper, we show that, as far as SNR-constrained control is concerned, the use of zero-order hold may be preferable to first-order hold on first- or second-order plants with delay. We thus provide a result on the effect of sampled-data hold functions when the sampling period is given. As a second contribution, we analyze the effect of employing an approximate discrete-time representation on minimum data rates for stabilization. © 2018 AACC.;-;English;Conference Paper

Bragstads plass 2D, Trondheim, N-7491, Norway;Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a technology that estimates the electrical properties of a body or a cross section. Its main advantages are its non-invasiveness, low cost and operation free of radiation. The estimation of the conductivity field leads to low resolution images compared with other technologies, and high computational cost. However, in many applications the target information lies in a low intrinsic dimensionality of the conductivity field. The estimation of this low-dimensional information is addressed in this work. It proposes optimization-based and data-driven approaches for estimating this low-dimensional information. The accuracy of the results obtained with these approaches depends on modelling and experimental conditions. Optimization approaches are sensitive to model discretization, type of cost function and searching algorithms. Data-driven methods are sensitive to the assumed model structure and the data set used for parameter estimation. The system configuration and experimental conditions, such as number of electrodes and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), also have an impact on the results. In order to illustrate the effects of all these factors, the position estimation of a circular anomaly is addressed. Optimization methods based on weighted error cost functions and derivate-free optimization algorithms provided the best results. Data-driven approaches based on linear models provided, in this case, good estimates, but the use of nonlinear models enhanced the estimation accuracy. The results obtained by optimization-based algorithms were less sensitive to experimental conditions, such as number of electrodes and SNR, than data-driven approaches. Position estimation mean squared errors for simulation and experimental conditions were more than twice for the optimization-based approaches compared with the data-driven ones. The experimental position estimation mean squared error of the data-driven models using a 16-electrode setup was less than 0.05% of the tomograph radius value. These results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can estimate an object's position accurately based on EIT measurements if enough process information is available for training or modelling. Since they do not require complex calculations it is possible to use them in real-time applications without requiring high-performance computers. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.;Cost functions- Costs- Electric impedance- Electric impedance measurement- Electric impedance tomography- Electrodes- Errors- Estimation- Learning algorithms- Mean square error- Signal to noise ratio- Three term control systems- Tomography- Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)- Electrical impedance tomography- Experimental conditions- High performance computers- Intrinsic dimensionalities- Optimization algorithms- Optimization-based algorithm- System configurations- Optimization;English;Article

Thus, the stability and the design process can be carried out by means of standard control methods. Besides, it reduces the computational burden because the minimization process does not consider the output predictions. In this work, the linear dynamic is included by designing an integral state-feedback linear controller.

This work addresses the problem by considering a wide set of possible plants, both first- and second-order continuous-time systems with time delays and zeros, leading to PI and PID controllers. The use of structured uncertainties to handle neglected dynamics allows to expand the range of processes to be considered. The proposed approach takes into account the robustness of the controller with respect to these structured uncertainties by using the small-gain theorem. In addition, improved performance is sought through the minimisation of an upper bound to the closed-loop system H∞ norm. A Lyapunov–Krasovskii-type functional is used to obtain delay-dependent design conditions. The controller design is accomplished by means of a convex optimisation procedure formulated using linear matrix inequalities. In order to illustrate the flexibility of the approach, several examples considering recycle compensation, reduced-order controller design and a practical implementation are addressed.

The machine vision system uses a transillumination technique to acquire images of the clam-parasite tandem. To improve the light transmission properties of the clam and parasite tissues, a novel online flattening system to flatten the clam thickness was developed. The automatic detection of the parasite in a clam is accomplished by a binary decision tree classifier that analyzes clam images. The classifier was developed using a supervised pattern-recognition approach, and proper features were created using spectral, spatial, geometrical, and biological information, such as the relative transmittance, the location of the parasite in the clam, the shape of the parasite, and the anatomical regions of the clam.

The non-parametric method estimates the baseline based on a set of sampled basis vectors obtained from PCA applied over a previously composed continuous spectra learning matrix. The parametric method, however, uses an ANN to filter out the baseline. Previous studies have demonstrated that this method is one of the most effective for baseline removal. The evaluation of both methods was carried out by using a synthetic database designed for benchmarking baseline removal algorithms, containing 100 synthetic composed spectra at different signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and baseline slopes. In addition to deomonstrating the utility of the proposed methods and to compare them in a real application, a spectral data set measured from a flame radiation process was used. Several performance metrics such as correlation coefficient, chi-square value, and goodness-of-fit coefficient were calculated to quantify and compare both algorithms. Results demonstrate that the PCA-based method outperforms the one based on ANN both in terms of performance and simplicity. © Society for Applied Spectroscopy.;Principal component analysis- Signal to noise ratio- Baseline estimation- Baseline removal- Comparative analysis- Continuous spectrum- Correlation coefficient- Learning matrix- Nonparametric methods- Sampled bases- Neural networks;English;Article

Many mines are located in desert areas, and they need to pump water from isolated wells or from the ocean. Therefore, in order to satisfy the water demand, many high-power water pump stations are required. The operation of these systems is expensive due to the high energy cost. This paper presents a case of study of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system to assist the operation of a water pump station of a mineral processing operation in Chile. An economical analysis is carried out with respect to different design variables and the percentage of the total power required for operating the system in the less favorable conditions (degree of assistance). It is demonstrated that the maximum net present value is obtained for the maximum assistance, i.e., supplying the full energy in the less favorable conditions. However, the internal rate of return will be maximized at the point where the system only supplies the energy to satisfy the full demand at the most favorable conditions. Finally, the study shows that from an economical point of view, PV technology is an attractive alternative to support the mining operation at present time. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Earnings- Mineral industry- Pumps- Solar energy- Solar power generation- Economical analysis- Favorable conditions- Internal rate of return- Mineral processing- Net present value- Power generation economics- Solar photovoltaic system- Technical evaluation- Economic analysis;English;Article

Indeed, in order to achieve appropriate, both dynamic and static, responses for all operating frequencies, the number of samples per period is kept constant and independent of the ac mains frequency. This allows a fixed resolution of the sensed voltages and/or currents, which is preferable if high-performance digital control schemes are required. However, imposing a constant number of samples per period requires a variable sampling time in systems that feature variable ac mains frequency. On the other hand, predictive control has been developed and well documented just for a constant sampling frequency. This work presents how to extend the predictive control algorithms for variable sampling time allowing high-performance waveforms and wider ac mains frequency range. Simulated and experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy which corroborates the mathematical and model analysis. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Algorithms- Digital control systems- Power converters- Constant sampling frequency- Control strategies- Number of samples- Operating frequency- Predictive control- Predictive control algorithm- Variable frequencies- Variable sampling- Sampling;English;Article

The parameters error can be due to both a poor estimation and their time variant behavior, as the grid parameters in grid connected static power converters. Contrary to the standard FCS-MPC approach that tracks a system output reference, the proposed scheme is based on a system input reference tracking that can be obtained from a state-feedback. In the proposed scheme, output system integrators are added to modify the dynamic performance and ensure zero steady-state error under parameters errors. This approach overcomes one important disadvantage that presents the conventional FCS-MPC strategy which is the dependence of a model with accurate parameters to avoid performance degradation. The results verify the correct performance in both with or without parameters errors. © 2016 IEEE.;Energy conversion- Errors- Feedback- Model predictive control- Predictive control systems- State feedback- Static converters- Dynamic performance- Finite control set- Parameter sensitivities- Performance degradation- Reference-tracking- Static power converters- Three phase vsi- Zero steady state error- Power converters;English;Conference Paper

The considered system has the actuator and the sensor in different nodes separated by a network. The strategy consists in minimizing the use of the network by only transmitting data from the observer to the controller and from the controller to the actuator when a trigger is generated by an event-trigger function. Based on the Lyapunov theory, conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived.

There are in the market several simulation environments for carrying out these tasks. However, there is still a need of having more flexible environments that can be easily integrated with other systems and tools such as real-time optimization and advanced data analysis. In this work, several standard tools such as Simulink®/Simulink®, OPC toolbox, RSLogix 5000, and FactoryTalk® are integrated to simulate a control strategy for a SAG mill designed to keep the mill operating in the stable region by manipulating the fresh ore feed. The implementation of this strategy is based on standard control blocks available in the ControlLogix Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

Técnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaíso, Chile;Controlled Power Converters are extensively used in industrial applications as they can adapt the electrical energy as required by the application. However, these devices must be properly commutated in order to control voltages and currents. Indeed, power converters are known to be multivariable, coupled, and nonlinear systems- therefore, the control technique needs to be chosen carefully. There are several control techniques reported in the literature for power converters and one of them is the Resonant Control (RC) mainly used on ac based systems. Advantageously, RC guarantees zero steady state error for a sinusoidal reference with a constant frequency and, in addition, it does not need a stationary to rotating reference frame transformation. However, the conventional RC approach requires the exact ac mains frequency value to ensure zero steady state error, being a significant drawback for applications where variable frequency environments are expected. This paper proposes an enhanced RC scheme capable to work under variable frequency scenarios, as in weak and micro grid systems while guaranteeing zero steady state error. The scheme results in a simple algorithm based upon discrete mathematics whose parameters become independent of the ac grid frequency. Results show the feasibility of the proposed approach even under severe ac frequency variations (over 100%) while featuring a stable control loop operation and zero steady state error. © 2016 IEEE.;Energy conversion- Errors- Multivariable systems- Power control- Power converters- Resonance- Control techniques- Discrete mathematics- Frequency variation- Micro-grid systems- Resonant controls- Rotating reference frame- Variable frequencies- Zero steady state error- Electric power system control;English;Conference Paper

Thus efficient and effective control and estimation algorithms are required to address the application of tomographic technologies in process control. Several authors have proposed to address this problem by using linear approaches, but their performance is limited by the linear assumption.

Many mines are located in desert areas and they need to pump water from isolated wells or from the ocean. To satisfy the water demand many high power water pump stations are required. The operation of these systems is expensive due to the high-energy cost. This paper presents a case of study of a solar system to assist the operation of a water pump station of a mineral operation in Chile. An economical analysis is carried out with respect to different design variables and the percentage of the total power required for operating the system in the less favorable conditions (degree of assistance). It demonstrates that the maximum net present value is obtained for the maximum assistance, i.e. supplying the full energy in the less favorable conditions. However, the internal rate of return will be maximized at the point where the system only supplies the energy to satisfy the full demand at the most favorable conditions. Finally the study shows that from an economical point of view PV technology is an attractive alternative to support the mining operation at present time. © 2015 IEEE.;Earnings- Economic analysis- Interactive computer systems- Mineral industry- Pumps- Solar energy- Solar power generation- Economical analysis- Favorable conditions- High-energy costs- Internal rate of return- Mining operations- Net present value- Power generation economics- Technical evaluation- Industrial economics;English;Conference Paper

Micro-grid and weak-grid systems are commonly associated to distribute non-conventional power generation sources, where the voltage and frequency deviation are as a result of unbalances between generation and consumed power. This work studies and develops a Series Compensator control for a non-constant power supply. The study is focused on the rectifier control in order to get a stable closed loop system for sags and swells as well as frequency variations. In addition, an operating region study is performed in order to evaluate the capabilities and to find the maximum range of frequency variation tolerated by this topology.

In addition, also a new way to define the fictitious outputs is proposed, leading to observers with fewer parameters than with the approach widely used in literature.

Part of 2014 IEEE Multi-conference on Systems and Control, MSC 2014;1;Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile;Multidimensional sensors such as spectral sensors have been widely used in monitoring tasks. They provide simultaneously many measurements distributed over the spectra. These measurements are normally highly correlated and the important information lies in a lower dimensional space. Their direct use in control schemes has been limited by the multidimensional nature of the sensor output and the fact that spectral measurements can be affected by many factors. Thus some processing is required to extract the important information out of them. In this work, the use of a spectral sensor to control a mixing process is addressed. In this application, the measurements are described as a linear combination of some spectral basis functions and the dynamics by linear time invariant systems. Two control strategies based on the information provided by a spectral sensor are proposed and analyzed. A simple example illustrates the main characteristics and differences of the proposed approaches. © 2014 IEEE.;Controllers- Invariance- Linear systems- Time varying control systems- Control strategies- Controller designs- Dimensional spaces- Linear combinations- Linear time invariant systems- Multidimensional nature- Process applications- Spectral measurement- Process control;English;Conference Paper

This theory provides a reliable method of thickener design, simulation and control. However, a process model, simple or sophisticated, empirical or phenomenological, is useful only if it is possible to determine, in an objective way, its experimental parameters. Although it is important for a mineral processing plant to perform periodical laboratory test to determine thickening parameters, and in this way adjust the operation, not always these tests represent the behavior of the material in the process. It is important to be able to determine these parameters directly in the thickeners.

When EIT is used in these applications, the measurements are usually conducted using a probe sensor that is positioned inside the process vessel. Full three-dimensional reconstruction is possible, however, it leads to time-consuming reconstructions. For simplifying the reconstruction procedure and reducing the computation time, two different reduced forward models are proposed. In the first model, the conductivity is considered to be rotationally symmetric, that is, the conductivity and the potential do not change in the angular direction. This model is accurate as far as the given assumptions are fulfilled. In the second model, the conductivity is considered to be invariant also in the radial direction. This one-dimensional (1D) forward model is highly approximative and therefore the reconstructed conductivity profile is useless with conventional reconstruction approach. The approximation error approach is applied to compensate the errors due to forward model reduction. The proposed approximative forward models are evaluated through computer simulations of phase interface detection showing feasible reconstructions and significant reduction in reconstruction time without compromising reconstruction accuracy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.;Aluminum sheet- Electric impedance- Electric impedance measurement- Electric impedance tomography- Errors- Froth flotation- Geometry- One dimensional- Phase interfaces- 1-D models- Approximation errors- Cylindrical symmetry- Electrical impedance tomography- Probe sensor- Probes;English;Article

Unlike in three-phase inverters, where the Fortescue Transform or Park Transformation can be applied in order to simplify the design of the controllers, for single-phase systems they cannot be directly applied making the control a difficult task if a rotating reference frame is chosen. On the other hand, Resonant Control (RC) is a control strategy that allows working with sinusoidal references and ensuring zero steady state error. This paper studies the resonant control of a single-phase CSI in a three-phase array, considering a design in continuous as well as discrete time domain. The resonant control is justified because the current sources should not be considered equals at all times, leading to independent control in each phase, or each cell, where the current source value and the load current can be feed-forward into the controller both of them disturbances, making the load voltage control in each cell easier to accomplish. To corroborate the mathematical analysis, the proposed control scheme is tested under different conditions and disturbances, including a stability study. © 2014 IEEE.;Controllers- Industrial electronics- Resonance- Controllers- Industrial electronics- Resonance- Current source inverter- Discrete time-domain- Mathematical analysis- Park transformation- Rotating reference frame- Single-phase systems- Three-phase inverter- Zero steady state error- Independent control- Single phase current- Single phase current source inverter (CSI)- Electric inverters- Electric inverters;English;Conference Paper

These estimates are based on a set of measured induced voltages generated by some currents injected to the process. Processing the measurements of an EIT sensor to estimate the underlying changes in the conductivity field requires the use of high dimensional models and solve a nonlinear optimization problem. In some applications the changes in the conductivity are due to changes in just a couple of factors, and therefore the sensor output can be described by a set of variables lying in a lower dimensional space. Manifold Learning Algorithms can learn these low dimensional spaces embedded in the measurement space. In this work, three popular MLA are analyzed as tools to discover manifolds in the EIT measuring space. Several simulations and experimental results show that Laplacian eigenmap algorithm is a suitable MLA for this type of applications. © 2013 IEEE.;Comparative analysis- Electrical impedance tomography- High-dimensional models- Low-dimensional spaces- Manifold learning algorithm- Non-intrusive sensors- Non-linear optimization problems- Tomographic sensors- Electric impedance tomography- Estimation- Learning algorithms- Sensors- Industrial electronics;English;Conference Paper

These systems are called conservative if furthermore they leave invariant a particular Legendre submanifold defining their thermodynamic properties. In this paper we address the stabilization of controlled input-output contact systems. Firstly it is shown that it is not possible to achieve stability on the complete Thermodynamic Phase Space. As a consequence, the stabilization is addressed on some invariant Legendre submanifold of the closed-loop system. For structure preserving feedback of input-output contact systems, i.e., for the class of feedback that renders the closedloop system again a contact system, the closed-loop invariant Legendre submanifolds have been characterized. The stability of the closed-loop system has then been proved using Lyapunov's second method. The results are illustrated on the classical thermodynamic process of heat transfer between two compartments and an exterior control.

Such systems systematically arise in models established in Chemical Engineering. The differential-geometric of these systems is a contact form in the same manner as the symplectic 2-form is associated to Hamiltonian models of mechanics. In this paper we study the feedback preserving the geometric structure of controlled contact systems and render the closed-loop system again as a contact system. It is shown that only a constant control preserves the canonical contact form, hence a state feedback necessarily changes the closed-loop contact form. For strict contact systems, arising from the modelling of thermodynamic systems, a class of state feedback that shapes the closed-loop contact form and contact Hamiltonian function is proposed. The state feedback is given by the composition of an arbitrary function and the control contact Hamiltonian function. The similarity with structure preserving feedback of input-output Hamiltonian systems leads to the definition of input-output contact systems and to the characterization of the feedback equivalence of input-output contact systems. An irreversible thermodynamic process, namely the heat exchanger, is used to illustrate the results. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the normalized optical transmittance of the clam and its parasite have been disclosed for the first time using a hyperspectral imaging system. It has been identified that, in the spectral band of 600-950 nm, the normalized optical transmittance of clam's mantle cavity changes in the presence or absence of the parasite. This relative change in the normalized optical transmittance has been used as an effective spectral feature for designing parasite detectors. As a proof of concept two detectors have been designed. The first detector, which relies on all the hyperspectral information, achieved a perfect detection accuracy in identifying parasite-infected clams. The second detector, which is based on a reduced number of hyperspectral bands, achieved an 85% detection accuracy. These results provide insights on the fundamental trade-off between detection accuracy and the amount of hyperspectral information for parasite detection in clams. ©2013 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.;Clams- Edotea magellanica- Hyperspectral Imaging- Mulina edulis- Optoelectronic imaging- Parasite- Computer vision- Image processing- Molluscs- Opacity- Shellfish- Spectroscopy- Detectors- Bivalvia- Edotia- Mulinia;English;Article

These quasi-port-Hamiltonian systems are defined with respect to a structure matrix and a modulating function which depends on the thermodynamic relation between state and co-state variables of the system. This modulating function itself is the product of some positive function γ and the Poisson bracket of the entropy and the energy function. This construction guarantees that the Hamiltonian function is a conserved quantity and simultaneously that the entropy function satisfies a balance equation containing an irreversible entropy creation term. In the second part of the paper, we suggest a lift of the Irreversible Port-Hamiltonian Systems to control contact systems defined on the Thermodynamic Phase Space which is canonically endowed with a contact structure associated with Gibbs' relation. For this class of systems we have suggested a lift which avoids any singularity of the contact Hamiltonian function and defines a control contact system on the complete Thermodynamic Phase Space, in contrast to the previously suggested lifts of such systems. Finally we derive the formulation of the balance equations of a CSTR model as an Irreversible Port-Hamiltonian System and give two alternative lifts of the CSTR model to a control contact system defined on the complete Thermodynamic Phase Space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;Chemical reactors- Entropy- Phase space methods- Statistical mechanics- System theory- Thermodynamics- Balance equations- Conserved quantity- Contact structure- Contact systems- Energy functions- Entropy function- Irreversible process- Irreversible thermodynamics- Modulating functions- Phase spaces- Poisson brackets- Port-Hamiltonian systems- Structure matrix- Hamiltonians;English;Article

In a first instance irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems are extended to encompass coupled mechanical and thermodynamical systems, leading to the definition of reversible-irreversible port Hamiltonian systems. In a second instance, the formalism is used to suggest a class of passivity based controllers for thermodynamic systems based on interconnection and Casimir functions.

Successful application to different topologies and applications such as two-level voltage source inverters, neutral-point-clamped and cascaded H-bridge inverters, and matrix converters has shown its potential in power converters. However, when multiple control objectives are desired, weighting factors are required to appropriately select the switching states. The selection of these factors is a time-consuming and complex task. In this work, the standard selection stage is replaced by a fuzzy decision-making strategy, considering, as a case study, the control of both load and supply currents in the direct matrix converter (DMC). As a result, weighting-factor selection is avoided, and a simple selection scheme is obtained for this application. In addition, a more natural design approach to the state selection is opened for other applications.

This work studies a predictive control scheme for power converters that are directly connected to the AC network featuring large frequency variations. The proposed scheme considers a fixed number of samples per period independent of the network frequency, leading to a variable sampling time under varying frequency conditions. This feature is advantageous when frequency has an important operating range because it ensures a constant resolution of the measured system variables. As discrete predictive control requires the sampling time to make accurate predictions, a synchronization system is proposed that ensures a fixed number of samples per cycle through continuous adjustment of the sampling time. Simulations show good performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.;Accurate prediction- Frequency variation- Network frequency- Power generation sources- Predictive control- Static power converters- Synchronization systems- Wide frequency range- Electric power distribution- Power converters- Industrial electronics;English;Conference Paper

The increase of capacity in many copper concentrators has lead to an increased effort for recovering the maximum amount of water in the solid-liquid separation process. Thickeners work continuously to produce a concentrated underflow and a water overflow free from particulate matter. The behavior of many processes can be represented by a set of intensive and extensive variables. In this case, practice has shown that standard feedback control based on intensive variables has not been very easy to tune and effective in providing consistent operations. In many plants, thickeners operate with poor standards, with high dosages of flocculants, overflows with high fine particles contents and highly variable underflows. This work presents a novel nonlinear PI controller which is able to stabilize thickener operation using a simple control structure. An internationally accepted model and calibration using plant data is used to illustrate the design methodology and the level of performance attained by the controllers. The analysis of the results points out the improved performance by using extensive variables.

The proposed classification and zoning models are oriented toward the stochastic tracking of failures via emergency brigades. This work, instead of training a big ANN model, proposes to decompose the problem into two smaller ones in order to take advantage of the available previous knowledge and improved training. The classification model is based on an ANN with supervised learning (SL). The zoning representation is based on a simple binary perceptron with constructive learning (CL). In this article, the theoretical elements underpinning the proposal are detailed and justified. The performance of the proposed models is verified through various real primary network applications.

Particularly, Mulinia edulis clams are susceptible to have a parasite infection caused by the isopoda Edotea magellanica, which represents a serious commercial problem commonly addressed by manual inspection. In this work a machine vision system capable of automatically detect the parasite using a clam image is presented. The parasite visualization inside the clam is achieved by an optoelectronic imaging system based on an transillumination technique. Furthermore, automatic parasite detection in the clam's image is accomplished by a pattern recognition system designed to quantitatively describe parasite candidate zones. The extracted features are used to predict the parasite presence by means of a binary decision tree classifier.

The multi-variable, nonlinear, and coupled features of these topologies make the control strategy design a difficult task. Controlling this kind of system with single-variable linear controllers-as proposed in this work-presents significant advantages compared with other approaches as simplicity in the design steps due to the large amount of tools developed for this kind of schemes. Particularly, a classic design method based on the root locus approach is used to choose the controllers parameters in order to achieve a given dynamical behavior. Compensation of reactive power and fundamental frequency disturbances is presented in this paper as part of a general control strategy for multilevel active power filters. The proposed control strategy is implemented on the TMS320C6713 DSP-based system for a low-power laboratory prototype, and thus the controllers design is carried out on the discrete-time and -frequency domain. Also, due to the inherent asymmetries among the power cells in a modular topology, a dedicated local control strategy is proposed to ensure a symmetrical distribution of the power among the power cells. This feature allows the semiconductor devices of each module to operate under the same voltage and current ratings. Simulated and experimental results showing stationary and transient conditions demonstrate the feasibility of the control scheme. © 2012 IEEE.;Controllers- Design- Discrete time control systems- Frequency domain analysis- Linear control systems- Power quality- Root loci- Semiconductor devices- Topology- Active power Filter- Dynamical behaviors- Fundamental frequencies- Linear controls- Local control strategies- Multilevel power converters- Transient conditions- Unified power quality conditioners- Quality control;English;Article

Efficient algorithms are required to address the application of tomographic technologies in the process industries. Several authors have proposed to address this issue by augmenting the measurement vector with fictitious outputs in order to solve the problem using state estimators. This paper analyses the solution of linear inverse problems from the perspective of a state estimation problem, providing links between regularization, observability and convergence of the algorithms. In addition, it also proposes an alternative way to define the fictitious outputs, leading to observers with fewer parameters than the one widely used in the literature.

In particular, in many applications the output maps are defined in terms of an implicit function. In this context, it is necessary to design an observer which does not require to invert explicitly the output map in order to obtain the estimated output. The proposed approach considers this particular requirement, a nonlinear perturbation term associated to the dynamic part, characterized in terms of a Lipschitz constant, and a continuous differentiable output map. The stability of the non-linear error dynamic is analysed by transforming the error dynamic into a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system.

The algorithm estimates the continuous background based on previous information obtained from a learning database of continuous flame spectra. Then, the discontinuous flame emission is calculated by subtracting the estimated continuous baseline from the measured spectrum. The key issue subtending the learning database is that the continuous flame emissions are predominant in the sooty regions, in absence of discontinuous radiation. The proposed algorithm was tested using natural gas and bio-oil flames spectra at different combustion conditions, and the goodness-of-fit coefficient (GFC) quality metric was used to quantify the performance in the estimation process.

To ensure the periodic tracking/rejection, a modified state-space repetitive control structure is considered. Conditions in a quasi linear matrix inequality form are proposed to simultaneously compute a stabilizing state feedback gain and an anti-windup gain. Provided that the references and disturbances belong to a certain admissible set, these gains guarantee that the trajectories of the closed-loop system starting in a certain ellipsoidal set contract to the linearity region of the closed-loop system, where the presence of the repetitive controller ensures the periodic tracking/rejection. © 2006 IEEE.;Admissible set- Anti-windup- Constrained controls- Control saturation- Multi-input , multi-output systems- Periodic signal- Quasi-linear- Repetitive control- Repetitive controller- Saturating actuator- Stabilizing state- State-space- Closed loop systems- Control system analysis- Linear matrix inequalities- MIMO systems- Periodic structures- State feedback- Surface discharges- Controllers;English;Article

It is shown that only a constant feedback preserves the canonical contact form, hence a structure preserving feedback implies a contact system with respect to a new contact form. A necessary condition is stated as a matching equation in the feedback, the contact vector fields, the canonical contact form and the closed-loop contact form. Furthermore, for the case of strict contact vector fields a set of solutions is characterized for a particular class of feedback and the relation with classical results on feedback control of Hamiltonian control systems is established. The control synthesis is briefly addressed and illustrated on a simple example. © 2011 IEEE.;Hamiltonians- Closed loops- Constant feedback- Contact forms- Contact systems- Contact vectors- Control synthesis- Hamiltonian controls- Structure-preserving- Feedback;English;Conference Paper

However, intrinsic limitations of analog hardware, such as device mismatch, charge leakage, and noise, reduce the accuracy of analog arithmetic circuits, degrading the performance of large-scale adaptive systems. In this paper, we present a detailed mathematical analysis that relates different parameters of the hardware limitations to specific effects on the convergence properties of linear perceptrons trained with the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. Using this analysis, we derive design guidelines and introduce simple on-chip calibration techniques to improve the accuracy of analog neural networks with a small cost in die area and power dissipation.

The increase of capacity in many copper concentrators has lead to an increased effort for recovering the maximum amount of water in the solid-liquid separation process. Thickeners work continuously to produce a concentrated underflow and a water overflow free from particulate matter. These equipments are highly nonlinear systems, and practice has shown that standard feedback control has not been very effective in providing consistent operations. In many plants, thickeners operate with poor standards, with high dosages of flocculants, overflows with high fine particles contents and highly variable underflows. This work presents an overview of the current control strategies found in the industry and the literature for controlling the level of sediment and the underflow concentration, and compares them using a calibrated simulator of an industrial thickeners. The phenomenological model is described along the necessary steps for obtaining its parameters from plant data. The analysis of the results points out the weakness of each control strategies, and provides hints on how to improve their performance by using the insight given by the phenomenological model. © 2011 IFAC.;Industrial chemicals- Mineral industry- Models- Parameter estimation- Current control strategy- Geographical locations- Mineral processing industry- Phenomenological modeling- PI control- Solid liquid separation- Thickener- Underflow concentration- Fuzzy control;English;Conference Paper

As results of this analysis, Local and Global Spectral Radiation Measurements (LSRM and GSRM respectively) techniques are proposed, and guidelines for selecting the radical emission bands and spatial location of photodetectors are given. Two types of experiments have been performed in order to demonstrate the reliability of the GSRM technique for combustion characterization. In the first experiment, the LSRM and the GSRM have been implemented by using a home made sensor array, based on silicon photodiodes, for sensing the excited CH* and C2* radicals in a natural gas flame. It has been experimentally demonstrated that by using the GSRM, the signal's dispersion can be reduced to about 86% for the CH* and 76% for the C2* with respect to the obtained values with LSRM methodology. In the second experiment, the GSRM technique has been applied for sensing the CH* and C2* radicals, where it has been found that the signals emissions ratio C2*/CH* provides a good indicator of the thermal combustion efficiency and the CO pollutants emissions, with small dispersion. Thus, the GSRM technique has corroborated the usefulness of that ratio for combustion monitoring. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.;Co-pollutants- Combustion characterization- Combustion efficiencies- Combustion monitoring- Emission bands- Flame spectrum- Natural gas flames- Radiometric analysis- Silicon photodiode- Small dispersion- Spatial location- Spectral band- Spectral emission- Spectral radiation- Dispersions- Experiments- Gas emissions- Monitoring- Natural gas- Optical sensors- Optoelectronic devices- Sensor arrays- Combustion- silicon- analytic method- article- chemoluminescence- combustion- gas- priority journal- radiometry- sensor- spectroscopy;English;Article

The robustness of the PID control with respect to structured uncertainties is investigated with the small-gain theorem and better performance is sought through the minimization of an upper bound to the closed-loop system H ∞ norm. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii type functional is used yielding delay-dependent design conditions.

Osvaldo Aranha 103, 90035-190 Porto Alegre-RS, Brazil- University of Concepción, Department of Electrical Engineering, Casilla 43-C, Correo 3, Concepción, Chile;"This paper addresses the problem of tracking periodic references for uncertain linear systems subject to control saturation. Accordingly to the internal model principle, a control loop containing the modes of both the references and additive disturbances is considered. From this structure, conditions in a ""quasi"" LMI form are proposed to simultaneously compute a stabilizing state feedback gain and an anti-windup gain. Provided that the references and disturbances belong to a certain admissible set, these gains guarantee that the trajectories of the closed-loop system starting in a certain invariant ellipsoidal set contract to the linearity region of the closed-loop system, ensuring therefore the perfect reference tracking. Based on these conditions, an optimization problem aiming at the maximization of the invariant set of admissible states and/or the maximization of the set of admissible references/disturbances is proposed. Numerical examples to illustrate the method are provided. ©2009 IEEE.";Linear systems- Numerical methods- State feedback- Additive disturbance- Control saturation- Internal model principle- Optimization problems- Periodic reference- Periodic reference tracking- Reference-tracking- Uncertain linear system- Closed loop systems;English;Conference Paper

For confined gas flames the ratio between the signal corresponding to C2* and CH"" was successfully correlated with the CO pollutant emissions and the combustion efficiency.

This paper shows that interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control, well known for electrical and mechanical applications, can be used to design high performance averaging level controllers for interconnected tank circuits, using physically motivated mass balance principles. The proposed method can deal with multiple tanks described by nonlinear dynamics with state constraints and rigourously establish the stability of the closed loop system. Furthermore, the transient behavior can be easily regulated, selecting the mass storage function assigned to the system, while keeping the control signal positive. As far as we know, none of the existing methods can address all these issues within a unifying framework.

The optimization of this process plays an important role in the improvement of a concentrator plant efficiency, since even small increases in the valuable recovery mean an important economic impact. In order to exploit the serial structure of this process, the dynamic programming technique is used. The optimization problem is solved considering phenomenological models for each flotation bank of the circuit, validated using process data obtained from several sampling surveys carried out in a rougher flotation circuit of a Chilean mineral processing plant. The control objective is the minimization of the Cu tailing grade in each bank given a final Cu concentrate grade. Simulation results show a good correspondence between the proposed optimization strategy and the actual operating practices at the rougher flotation plant under study, considering different operational scenarios. © 2006.;Computer simulation- Dynamic programming- Optimal control systems- Optimization- Problem solving- Flotation circuits- Plant efficiency- Rougher flotation- Flotation;English;Article

A simple and noise-immune closed-loop identification approach based on step responses is presented. This method is entirely conceived in the time domain, and it is flexible enough to identify a set of simple low-order models that can be obtained from either reference or disturbance closed-loop step responses. This latter feature makes the proposed approach an ideal option as a building block of an adaptive controller.

The increase of capacity in many copper concentrators has lead to an increased effort for recovering the maximum amount of water in the solid-liquid separation process. Thickeners work continuously to produce a concentrated underflow and a water overflow free from particulate matter. These equipments are highly nonlinear systems, and practice has shown that standard feedback control has not been very effective in providing consistent operations. In many plants, thickeners operate with poor standards, with high dosages of flocculants, overflows with high fine particles contents and highly variable underflows. This work presents an overview of the current control strategies found in the industry and the literature for controlling the level of sediment and the underflow concentration, and compares them using a calibrated simulator of an industrial thickeners. The phenomenological model is described along the necessary steps for obtaining its parameters from plant data. The analysis of the results points out the weakness of each control strategies, and provides hints on how to improve their performance by using the insight given by the phenomenological model. © 2011 IFAC.;Industrial chemicals- Mineral industry- Models- Parameter estimation- Current control strategy- Geographical locations- Mineral processing industry- Phenomenological modeling- PI control- Solid liquid separation- Thickener- Underflow concentration- Fuzzy control;English;Conference Paper

However, teaching SDN-related concepts is a challenge due to the inherent nature of this paradigm, its detailed technological tools/skill sets, and the continual evolution of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. As a result, there is a growing need to support new initiatives to develop applied research and hands-on training methodologies. Accordingly, this article presents a framework that has been developed/evolved over the past few years for teaching and conducting research activities related to SDN. The key idea here is to leverage the close relationship between SDN, real-world ICT problems, and innovative services development. Thus, the proposed framework integrates actors, stakeholders, phases, and components, along with their interrelationships in an applied research environment.

In this paper, optimal multiculture network design is used to improve the network reliability in the presence of correlated attacks. The multiculture network design is formalized using two sequential optimization problems: The first one for optimally selecting the number of network devices from each available vendor at the design stage, and the second one for optimally placing the devices in the network topology.

The algorithm considers the energy use and the remaining energy of the nodes, and steers a Monte-Carlo-based allocation according to the following rationale: images should be mapped more likely onto those nodes that communicate and process faster, consume less energy, and possess more energy reservoirs. Simulation results show that these simple ideas allow the allocation algorithm to deal efficiently with the fundamental tradeoff between turnaround time and energy. © 2013 IEEE.;Allocation algorithm- Distributed computing systems- Distributed systems- Energy reservoirs- Hand held device- Handheld computing- Remaining energies- Task allocation- Algorithms- Distributed computer systems- Energy efficiency- Turnaround time- Video signal processing;English;Conference Paper

Operations have to deal with system specific station commands and individual setup procedures. Neither the scheduler nor the correlator nor the data-analyst gets real-time feedback about system parameters during a session. Changes in schedules after the start of a session by remote are impossible or at least quite difficult. For future scientific approaches, a more flexible mechanism would optimize the usage of resources at the sites. Therefore shared-observation control between world-wide telescopes, remote attendance/control as well as completely unattended-observations could be useful, in addition to the classic way to run VLBI observations. To reach these goals, the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy (Bonn) have developed a software extension to the existing NASA Field System for remote control. It uses the principle of a remotely accessible, autonomous process cell as server extension to the Field System on the basis of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Based on this technology the first completely remote attended and controlled geodetic VLBI session between Wettzell, Germany and Concepción, Chile was successfully performed over 24 hours. This first test was extremely valuable for gathering information about the differences between VLBI systems and measuring the performance of internet connections and automatic connection re-establishments. During the 24h-session, the network load, the number of sent/received packages and the transfer speed were monitored and captured. It was a first reliable test for the future wishes to control several telescopes with one graphical user interface on different data transfer rates over large distances in an efficient way. In addition, future developments for an authentication and user role management will be realized within the upcoming NEXPReS† project. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.;Authentication- Data transfer- Geodesy- Graphical user interfaces- NASA- Radio astronomy- Remote control- Autonomous process- Flexible mechanisms- Future observations- Internet connection- Max Planck Institute- Observation control- Real-time feedback- Remote procedure calls- Data transfer rates;English;Conference Paper

At the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell a software extension to the existing NASA Field System has been developed for remote control of telescope observations in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. It uses the principle of a remotely accessible, autonomous process cell as server extension to the Field System. The communication is realized also for low transfer rates on the basis of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and uses generative programming with the interface software generator idl2rpc.pl developed at Wettzell. The user interacts with this system over a modern graphical user interface realized with wxWidgets. For security reasons the communication is automatically tunneled through a Secure Shell (SSH) session to the telescope.

The current process involves the physical storing and shipping of magnetic disks to these centers, where up to 5 days are needed for transportation. The need of a fast turnaround opened a new research line where all the collected data of observing radiotelescope stations is sent over the Internet. This technique is called eVLBI. Ideally the station is part of a National Research and Education Network (NREN) where multiple intercontinental routes are available. Under this scenario a new protocol has been developed which allows multiple parallel data flows with important throughput improvements. The unique properties of VLBI data imply the development of a custom load control based on user datagram protocol (UDP).

To support these changes new additional software components are required. The addition of (semi-) autonomous, remote accessible control features, which are becoming a reality now will provide needed support by offering reliable, safe, and modular structures from the high-level controlling layers down to the basic equipment interaction elements. An extension to the current NASA Field System (FS) with remotely accessible, autonomous process cells is being developed at the Wettzell Geodetic Observatory. It uses the specially designed middleware generator ""idl2rpc.pl"", developed at Wettzell, to generate the remote C++-interfaces for communication issues. A new modern graphical user interface in combination with an initial programmatic interface to the FS, both developed as extensions, demonstrate the capability for controlling radio telescopes remotely. The first successful remote control tests, with operators present, during regular experiments with the telescopes at O'Higgins, Concepción and Wettzell have demonstrated that this approach works well in the global communication network. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.";C++ (programming language)- Graphical user interfaces- Middleware- NASA- Autonomous process- Control features- Modular structures- Real-time access- Software component- Remote control;English;Conference Paper

Because the time difference measurements are precise to a few picoseconds, VLBI determines the relative positions of the cooperating radio telescopes to a few millimeter and the positions of the quasars to a few milliarcseconds. The transfer of the collected data from the radiotelescopes to the correlation centers is made through physical shipment of data discs which implies a delay of weeks in the turnaround. eVLBI is a technique which allows the direct transmission of the data to the correlators through Internet with multiples advantages, TIGO is a VLBI station located in Concepción, Chile with a limited bandwidth of few Mbps which must be increased in order to achieve an usable speed to work as an eVLBI station.

Due to magnetic saturation and cross magnetization, the performance and torque capability of a SynRM vary according to the position and value of the stator current. State of the art control methods usually assume parameters with constant values, especially the inductance, neglecting saturation, leading to possible uncertainty in the machine operation. Therefore, a current-vector trajectory to operate this type of machine, as a generator, in an extended speed range, with enhanced performance and considering magnetic saturation is proposed. A straightforward algorithm based on the inductance characteristic of the machine is used to calculate the trajectory of the stator current vector. This trajectory is evaluated via numerical simulation of an experimentally validated finite element model of a SynRM. The results show that the proposed current-vector trajectory can improve the torque capability to 5 % concerning the estimated trajectory without considering saturation. Experimental results are also provided to demonstrate the enhanced operation of the generator.

This methodology is based on the logical behavior of possible faulty magnet combinations produced by manufacturing tolerances. Groups of faulty combinations with a similar structure and cogging output are identified by means of a fuzzy-logic algorithm. Subsequently, only a single faulty combination of each group needs to be evaluated through the finite element method, which severely decreases the computational burden of the tolerance analysis. A 6-slot 4-pole and a 9-slot 6-pole machine were subject to tolerance analysis considering the displacement of the magnets.

From the results, it was found that U-shape machines are suitable for high-torque and low-mutual-inductance requirements, crucial in fault-tolerant applications, whilst H-shape machines offer low ripple torque and slightly lower performance indices for fault-tolerance applications. © 2021 IEEE.;Fault tolerance- Inductance- Particle swarm optimization (PSO)- Permanent magnets- Stators- Synchronous motors- Torque- Modular stator core- Modular stators- Modulars- Mutual inductance- Optimisations- Particle-swarm-optimization.- Permanent magnets synchronous machines- Stator core- Tooth coil windings- U shape- Finite element method;English;Conference Paper

Underwater operation requires that the machine parts have to be resistant to corrosion, and the electrically conducting parts need to be properly insulated from water. The machine under study consists of a rotor-surface permanent magnet rotor, protected by a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) cover, and a fully stainless stator. The novelty of the machine is found in the design and special materials used in the manufacture. The stator core is made of ferritic stainless steel laminations, and the selected winding material is polyvinyl chloride (PVC) insulated copper wire. An extra low-speed, stainless-core submersible PMSM was constructed and tested. To simplify the machine construction, a tooth-coil single-layer winding was adopted. An asymmetric stator design was selected to enhance the machine performance. The performance of the 1.7 kW, 80 r/min machine was analyzed by finite element analysis (FEA) and validated by experimental tests, where despite a very low rotational speed, 74% efficiency was reached at the target load point. The PMSM was found to be fully functional for the application. © 2013 IEEE.;Chlorine compounds- Corrosion resistance- Ferritic stainless steel- Fiber reinforced plastics- Polyvinyl chlorides- Silicon steel- Stators- Submersibles- Synchronous machinery- Winding- Experimental test- Insulated copper wires- Machine construction- Machine performance- Permanent magnet rotors- Permanent magnet synchronous machines- Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)- Underwater operations- Permanent magnets;English;Article

The use of the concentrated nonoverlapping winding, also known as tooth-coil winding, has certain advantages. In addition, asymmetric features can be exploited by adopting this winding configuration to improve the machine performance. The procedure involves increasing the stator tooth width and, to the same extent, reducing the adjacent stator tooth width. In this paper, an analytical method was employed to predict and understand the back-EMF behavior, and a finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to verify the analytical method. Furthermore, a detailed study of the machine performance (electromagnetic torque, flux density, and losses) was carried out by the FEA. The machine was built and tested to validate the performance of the machine. © 2013 IEEE.;Stators- Synchronous machinery- Winding- Analytical method- Electromagnetic torques- Flux densities- Machine performance- Nonoverlapping- Permanent magnet synchronous machines- Tooth coil windings- Winding configuration- Permanent magnets;English;Article

The method consists on calculating the instantaneous power by measuring the machine currents and estimating the back electromotive force (back-emf). The real-time back-emf estimation is based on tracking the no-load voltage through off-line harmonic analysis, and the mechanical position and speed, obtained with an incremental encoder.

Diagonal 647, Barcelona, 08028, Spain;Pelton turbines are important machines for power generation from a renewable energy source such as water. For power rates below 20 MW, the rotor of Pelton turbines is usually in horizontal position. Considering ideal mounting and operating conditions, there are no axial forces acting on the rotor. In practice, there is an hydraulic force due to the difference between nozzle centerline and bucket centerline, and there is a magnetic force due to the difference between axial position of stator and rotor magnetic field centers. These forces are supported by bearings. In this article, a nonlinear dynamic model considering these axial forces and bearings behavior is presented and solved for two different actual Pelton turbines. The nonlinear dynamic model allows determining and evaluating the source of axial motion and therefore provides valuable information in order to reduce it when the axial displacement is high enough to produce damage.

Dimensional tolerances and asymmetries associated with the modular topology are studied by means of finite element simulations in order to identify key parameters that increase the cogging torque above the expected values of a faultless machine. Among five selected dimensional parameters, it was found that angular displacement, radial displacement, and tooth–tip width deviations of the stator segments have the most significant impact on the cogging torque. Considering these three key parameters, a full-range tolerance analysis is carried out by means of a proposed superposition-based approach, evaluating all possible combinations of typical deviation values. It is concluded that the cogging torque increment, generated by tolerances, is relatively independent of the faultless tooth–tip width of the stator segments and the arc-to-pole ratio. Robustness of the TCW-MPMSM, regarding cogging torque generation, depends on both the tightness of the tolerances handled in the manufacturing process and the rated cogging torque: the lower the cogging torque of the ideal machine, the less robust is the machine and, therefore, manufacturing imperfections will be required to be tightened. © 2020 by the authors.

The proposed method combines the lower computational burden of analytical equations and the accuracy/flexibility of the finite element method. Moreover, only a two-dimensional finite element simulation of one slot pitch is required. This method can be applied to an arbitrary slot geometry and winding configuration. The slot leakage inductance of a 12-slot and 10-pole tooth-coil-winding permanent-magnet synchronous machine was evaluated through the proposed method and only finite element method simulation.

The materials to be used must be resistant to marine environments. Therefore, there are two alternatives: using stainless magnetic materials and non-corrosion resistant materials can be used by protecting them by coating. The two alternatives are studied. Non-isotropic stator teeth width are investigated. This type of asymmetry consists of varying the distance of the slots of the same phase, keeping the slot width constant. This is achieved since each group of slots of the same phase are in parallel. Therefore, by modifying the arrangement of the stator slots, the magnetic circuit is modified, which allows adjusting the electrical parameters of the generator without changing its size. A hysteresis torque analysis is presented due to the magnetic materials used. A 1.7 kW, 80 rpm, prototype machine with 24 slots and 20 poles is proposed.

The model is necessary to design and test a control strategy that maximizes the power conversion efficiency for the machine in a variable-speed renewable energy generation application. Since the machine under analysis is not a laboratory prototype, rather than a commercial one, none of the design and construction data are available, and the machine performance becomes impossible to estimate.

The main goal of this research is to develop a reliable and inexpensive alternative for power generation with no rare-earth materials and good performance and efficiency. A full-power back-to-back converter is used to inject the converted energy into the utility. This configuration allows to supply the SynRM with the required reactive power and to manage the speed variations due to the wind. An operating mode selector is developed to provide a wide speed range of operation. The analysis is carried out based on the models and parameters of an actual commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SynRM and a wind turbine prototype. Numerical simulation shows that the synchronous reluctance machine can operate satisfactorily converting energy in the whole wind speed range that is tolerable by the turbine. © 2015 IEEE.;-;English;Conference Paper

This kind of machine is gaining attraction in various fields of application due to its high efficiency, compactness and the capability of operating over a wide speed range. These features are highly desirable for generators especially those that operate from energy sources with variable speed. Performance of SynRM is mostly dependent on machine inductances, which are not constants due to magnetic saturation and effects of cross magnetization. State of the art control methods usually assume parameters with constant value neglecting saturation, leading to possible under-use of the machine. A control strategy to operate a SynRM as a generator, in an extended speed range, with high energy efficiency and considering magnetic saturation is proposed in this paper. Finite element analysis is used to establish the reference current vector trajectory to take full advantage of the machine. The control strategy is evaluated via numerical simulation of the machine operating under an actual wind profile demonstrating the higher efficiency and higher power conversion achieved with the proposed strategy. © 2016 IEEE.;Electric machinery- Electric power generation- Energy efficiency- Finite element method- Inductance- Magnetic flux- Magnetism- Reluctance motors- Saturation magnetization- Synchronous generators- Synchronous machinery- Torque- Control strategies- Electromagnetic analysis- High efficiency control- High energy efficiency- Machine controls- saliency- Synchronous reluctance generator- Synchronous reluctance machine- Electric machine control;English;Conference Paper

This approach allows obtaining the electromagnetic torque for a given value of tangential stress and outer diameter for the optimal diameter ratio, but can be used for any other diameter ratio. Analytical approach, avoiding numerical solutions, allows one to achieve the main dimensions of the machine in a much faster manner. By the introduction of a stator leakage flux factor and a saturation torque factor into the model a more precise estimation of the torque capability is obtained. The results show that the leakage flux and the iron saturations significantly reduce the torque developed especially, if high levels of tangential stress are reached.

However, the use of lower-cost materials and a simpler construction can often degrade the machine performance. One of the possible production process simplifications of electrical machines is the use of modular permanent magnet synchronous machines (MPMSM). Some analytical approaches to analyze machines with modular stator can be found in the literature but these fall in the accuracy or do not consider the U-Shape core structure. This paper presents an analytical model to estimate the no-load air-gap flux density distribution of a U-shape MPMSM with tooth-coil winding.

The model is necessary to design and test a control strategy that maximizes the power conversion efficiency for the machine in a variable-speed renewable energy generation application. Since the machine under analysis is not a lab prototype, but a commercial nature, none of the design and construction parameters data are available, and the machine performance as a generator is not easy to estimate. The model is first accomplished by using the data obtained by disassembling the machine and then it is adjusted to match the inductances profile predicted by the FE model and those measured experimentally. This paper includes the information about materials, geometry, and windings arrangement necessary to build the model in the FEMM (Finite Element Method Magnetics) software. The results show good agreement with those indicated by the literature allowing to the model to become an excellent tool to get a deep insight of the synchronous reluctance machine performance. © 2015 IEEE.;Electric generators- Inductance- Magnetic flux- Renewable energy resources- Saturation magnetization- Synchronous generators- Synchronous machinery- Electromagnetic analysis- Electromagnetic torques- Ripple torque- Saliency- Synchronous reluctance machine- Finite element method;Spanish;Conference Paper

A composite-body-based rotor assembly and a steel-laminated layer inserted on top of the magnets are used to reduce eddy-current losses in the PMs. A prototype of an axial flux generator for a heavy-duty vehicle following this structure is optimized, analyzed and measured. The tooth coil windings produce high-amplitude harmonics in the air gap and the large slot openings reduce the rotor flux. Consequently, a rotor structure that decreases the amount of harmonics travelling through the magnets is required. Steel laminations covering the magnets have positive effects on both phenomena.

The starting point is the load cycle instead of the steady-state rated operation point. The speed of the motor varies from zero to very high speeds. At low speeds, heavy overloading is used for starting, and the field-weakening region also plays an important role. Finding a suitable field-weakening point is one of the important design targets. At the lowest speeds, a high torque output is desired, and all current reserves of the supplying converter unit are used to achieve the torque. In this paper, a 110-kW 2.5-p.u. starting torque and a maximum 2.5-p.u. speed permanent-magnet traction motor will be studied.

In this paper a HIL-setup is used to emulate the behavior of a hydraulic pump with an electric motor/generator. The setup contained a real-time simulator (RTS), two electric motors and two frequency converters. A real-time simulator was used for simulating the hydraulic and mechanical parts of the hydraulic machine. In previous study, it was shown that a virtual model of a hydraulic machine in a HIL setup can be used for testing by emulating the hydraulic pump with an electric motor. As the built setup did not fulfill requirements, new components for this kind of HIL setup are needed to be chosen carefully: optimized for data transfer speed, low latency and suitable refresh rates. In this research an attempt to find the optimum electric motor parameters, for the emulation purpose of a hydraulic pump was made. The parameters should be chosen based on refresh rate of the motor and initial analysis to narrow down the choices.

We evaluated a system composed of a 3 kW wind generator feeding a battery bank of 48 V/880 Ah by means of a non-controlled 6-pulse rectifier. Connected to this battery bank was a 1.5 kW inverter that generated 220 V at 50 Hz, which powers a 1.1 kW single-phase electric pump. At the University of Concepcion, Chile, energy losses in each electrical component was determined using a data collection system configured to measure electrical variables in real time. The electrical power generated by the wind generator for different wind speeds averaged 38% lower than the power curve provided by the manufacturer. Electromechanical tests performed in a lab showed the operation efficiency of the electric generator of the wind turbine averaged 80%. This information, along with the electrical power output, and the wind velocity measured during field operation allowed us to determine the rotor's power coefficient Cp, which had a maximum value of 35%. For the stored energy components measured data indicated that the rectifier, the battery bank, and the inverter operated with average efficiencies of 95%, 78% and 86% respectively. The combined component efficiencies showed a maximum of 17% of the wind energy would be available for water pumping. Since a large amount of wind energy was dissipated during the energy conversion process, new configurations should be analyzed that could avoid such losses in wind pumping systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays, Permanent Magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance motors are often used in traction applications because of their ability to control the stator flux in the field weakening operation. Reluctance torque is produced due to the inductance difference between the direct and quadrature axes' inductances and the stator current linkage. Power density can be increased by adding interior permanent magnets to the machine. The authors were interested in studying whether the reluctance torque can also be beneficial when using non-overlapping concentrated windings. Two 25 kW motors were designed in the same frame. Both motors should give at least 2 p.u. torques at low speed and approximately 0.6 p.u. at double speed as the rated speed is fixed to 1000 rpm. Analytical computations are verified by finite element analysis utilizing Cedrat's Flux2D. It was noticed that a non-overlapping concentrated winding machine can also be used as traction motor and can further be designed to produce reluctance torque. The integer slot motor has been built and measured and thereby the theoretical computations are verified by real measurements. © 2011 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All righs reserved.;-;English;Article

This particular saliency feature is achieved by replacing a portion of the magnet material by a soft iron piece over the rotor pole. In this manner, the d-axis inductance is increased, whereas the q-axis inductance is almost not affected, leading to the condition that Ld is higher than Lq (negative saliency) corresponding to the inverse condition of typical PM machines. An expression for the optimum pole configuration is derived. It is shown that, with appropriate control of the stator current based on the machine's saliency, the unfavorable effects of magnet reduction on torque production can be compensated. It is also shown that the machine saliency affects the location of the operating points when it operates under vector control. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated with experimental results obtained from a prototype axial-flux PM machine that exhibits negative saliency.

This fact makes uncertain the calculation of the stator-rotor mutual reactance (Xm) and therefore the no-load voltage (Ef) is also undefined. Both inexactitudes have incidence on the power calculations. Especially sensitive is the determination of the power losses in the design procedure, because it is necessary to compare solutions with efficiencies over 95 per cent. In this paper a straightforward calculation procedure of the flux and current densities for a given machine size, taking into consideration ""exactly"" any degree of saturation for a given current field oriented control angle is presented.

This control strategy is intended for applications in wind power generation. The main goal of this scheme is to transfer the maximum power available in the wind to the electrical system, through an adequate handling of the stator currents in the generator. To do this, both the maximum power point tracking strategy and the maximum torque per ampere controls are used. While the first one has the advantage of not using wind speed measurement, the second aims to minimize generator losses. Furthermore, for operation above the rated speed, a field weakening control is performed and the amount of power extracted from the wind in this condition is evaluated. Results show that it is possible to obtain a higher amount of power if the machine has flux weakening capability. © 2009 IEEE.;Axial flux- Control strategies- Electrical systems- Field weakening control- Flux weakening- Maximum power- Maximum Power Point Tracking- Maximum Torque per Ampere- Optimum control- Permanent magnet generator- Permanent-magnet machine- Stator currents- Wind speed measurement- Electric drives- Electric machinery- Electric power generation- Permanent magnets- Photovoltaic effects- Pumps- Wind power- Electric generators;English;Conference Paper

Due to the rectangular slot geometry, stator teeth present a trapezoidal geometry with small tooth width close to the shaft, increasing as the diameter becomes larger. This fact introduces an uneven airgap flux distribution if a constant flux source, such as rectangular PM, is utilized to magnetize the machine. As a result, flux density over the stator tooth becomes irregular, inductance parameters are a function of the stator diameter and saliency varies according to machine load. All these effects degrade machine power capability for low and rated load. In this paper, a novel axial flux PM machine with tangential magnetization is presented. An analytic and numerical study is carried out to consider stator tooth geometry and its effect over machine saliency ratio. © 2008 IEEE.;Air-gap fluxes- Axial flux machines- Axial-flux pm machines- Constant power- Constant-flux sources- Flux densities- Machine loads- Machine saliencies- Magnet shapes- Numerical studies- Power capabilities- Radial-flux machines- Rectangular slots- Stator tooth- Trapezoidal geometries- Computational geometry- Dentistry- Permanent magnets- Stators- Machine design;English;Conference Paper

This torque is proportional to the PM flux and the reluctance variation, and is independent of the load current. In this paper, two methods for cogging torque reduction in an axial PM machine with field weakening capability are presented. The machine's rotor configuration considers two sections: one PM pole that provides the field excitation and one iron section in charge of providing low d-axix reluctance. Significant reduction of the cogging effects is achieved by adjusting stator geometry and rotor pole configuration. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis is used to demonstrate these improvements.

SAFE is a modern solution for fishery inspection that automatically discriminates fish species using machine learning. Here, we present a version of SAFE that classifies five target pelagic fish species in Chile: anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, hake, mote sculpin, and sardine. The system has two stages- the first detects and segments all fish appearing in an image. These segmented images then feed the second stage, which perform species classification. A database of approximately 266 images from these five fish species was constructed for training, validation, and testing purposes. For the fish detection stage, we exploited transfer learning to train Mask R-CNN architectures, an instance segmentation model. As for the fish species classification stage, we exploited transfer learning to train ResNet50 and VGG16 deep learning architectures. Results show that SAFE achieves between 90% and 96.3% macro-average precision (MP) when classifying the five fish species mentioned above. The best architecture, composed of a Mask R-CNN-based detector and a VGG16-based classifier, achieves an MP of 96.3%, which could process a single fish as quick as 16.67 FPS, and one whole 1920x1080-pixel image as quick as 2 FPS. © 2022 SPIE.;Computer vision- Convolutional neural networks- Deep neural networks- Fisheries- Network architecture- Transfer learning- Convolutional neural network- Deep convolutional neural network- Fish recognition- Fish recognition and classification- Fish species- Instance segmentation- Mask R-CNN- Resnet50- Transfer learning- VGG16- Fish;English;Conference Paper

The technique is based on the changes observed in the continuous spectrum of the visible–near-infrared (VIS–NIR) radiation that the blister melt emits while the chemical reactions of the sulfur elimination process are taking place. Specifically, the proposed technique uses an optical probe composed of an optical fiber, a collimating lens, and a quartz tube, which is immersed in the melt. This optical probe provides a field of view of the blowing zone where the desulfurization reaction occurs. The experimental results show that the melt VIS–NIR total irradiance evolves inversely to the SO2 concentration reported by a gas analyzer based on differential optical absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, the blister copper spectral emissivity as well as the total emissivity observed throughout the process show strong correlation with the sulfur content during desulfurization reaction. © 2021 by the authors.

Combustion experiments were performed in a bench reactor. In all the tests, the radiation emitted from the sulfide particle reactions was captured in the VIS–NIR range. The obtained spectral data were processed by using the airPLS (adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares) algorithm to remove their baseline, and principal component analysis (PCA) and the multivariate curve resolution method alternate least squares (MCR-ALS) methods were applied to identify the emission lines or spectral bands of copper oxides. The extracted spectral pattern is directly correlated with the emission profile reported in the literature, evidencing the potential of using spectral analysis techniques on copper sulfide combustion spectra. © 2021 by the authors.

In the specific case of copper pyrometallurgy, the situation is particularly challenging to incorporate the Industry 4.0 concept for the optimization of their operations. Currently, only two instruments can be identified at the commercial level: the Noranda pyrometer and the Online Production Control (OPC) system. The iron-making and steelmaking industries, however, present an advanced level of control based on monitoring and sensing networks throughout the entire process. This reality has served as a basis for developing a series of solutions based on radiometric sensors for copper pyrometallurgy. We present two types of sensing concept. The first one is applied to smelting and converting reactors based on the measurements of the radiation of the oxidation of different copper and iron sulfides. The second one considers hyperspectral imaging of molten phases flow during operations. The idea of this proposal is to transfer some commercial sensing technologies already in use in the steelmaking industry. In this article, the fundamentals of the sensor design, proofs of concept, and the initial industrial validations are reviewed. Finally, a discussion on the contribution of this knowledge and development opportunities within the framework of Industry 4.0 are addressed. © 2020 by the authors.

Firstly, nanobiosensors were designed and synthesized by chemically bonding gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with aptamer bioreceptors highly selective for four widely used antibiotics in the field of veterinary medicine, namely, Kanamycin, Ampicillin, Oxytetracycline and Sulfadimethoxine. When molecules of the antibiotics are present in the milk sample, the interaction with the aptamers induces random AuNP aggregation. This phenomenon modifies the initial absorption spectrum of the milk sample without antibiotics, producing spectral features that indicate both the presence of antibiotics and, to some extent, its concentration. Secondly, we designed and constructed an electro-opto-mechanic device that performs automatic high-resolution spectral data acquisition in a wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm. Thirdly, the acquired spectra were processed by a machine-learning algorithm that is embedded into the acquisition hardware to determine the presence and concentration ranges of the antibiotics. Our approach outperformed state-of-the-art standardized techniques (based on the 520/620 nm ratio) for antibiotic detection, both in speed and in sensitivity. © 2020 by the authors.

The technique employs our well-known constant-range-based nonuniformity correction algorithm as a preprocessing step and then an iteration in the z-axis Fourier-based deconvolution. The technique's ability to compensate for localized blur is demonstrated using two different real MWIR microscopic video sequences, captured from two microscopic living organisms using a Janos-Sofradir MWIR microscopy setup. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on real and simulated noisy infrared data by computing the root-mean-square error and the roughness Laplacian pattern indexes, which are specifically developed for the present work. © 2020 Optical Society of America;Biology- Iterative methods- Mean square error- Optical transfer function- Correction method- Experimental estimations- Infrared microscopy- Living organisms- Mid-wave infrared imageries- Nonuniformity correction algorithm- Pre-processing step- Root mean square errors- Infrared radiation- algorithm- animal- cytology- Daphnia- image enhancement- image processing- infrared radiation- microscopy- procedures- three-dimensional imaging- Algorithms- Animals- Daphnia- Image Enhancement- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Imaging, Three-Dimensional- Infrared Rays- Microscopy;English;Article

These species are typically generated by reactions occurring during the combustion (oxidation) of this iron sulfide mineral. Two detection schemes are addressed: the first consisting of measurements with a built‐in developed spectrometer with a high sensitivity and a high spectral resolution. The second one consisting of spectra measured with a low spectral resolution and a low sensitivity commercial spectrometer, but enhanced and analyzed with post signal processing and multivariate data analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA) and a multivariate curve resolution – the alternating least squares method (MCR‐ ALS). A non‐linear model is also proposed to reconstruct spectral signals measured during pyrite combustion. Different combustion conditions were studied to evaluate the capacity of the detection schemes to follow the spectral emissions of iron oxides. The results show a direct correlation between FeO and Fe3O4 spectral features intensity, and non‐linear relations with key combustion variables such as flame temperature, and the combusted sulfide mineral particle size. © 2020 by the authors.

Fixed pattern noise (FPN), resulting from pixel-to-pixel response nonuniformity, is a dominant source of error that manifests in collected imagery through the appearance of temporally and spatially correlated noise patterns that are mixed with each image. Furthermore, finite detector size coupled with imperfect system optics can introduce blurring effects and aliasing, ultimately reducing resolution in acquired images. Here, we propose a unified method to reduce FPN and recover high-frequency image content in IR microscopy images. The proposed method uses regularized nonlocal means to highlight spatial features in the scene while maintaining fine textural image details. We derive an iterative optimization method based upon a gradient descent minimization strategy that applies a Wiener deconvolution in each iteration to estimate the blur artifacts. The method is implemented within an embedded mid-wave IR imaging system for microscopy applications. We demonstrate a reduction in FPN and blurring artifacts, achieving improved image resolution in the reconstructed images that are apparent in recovered details on scene objects. © 2013 IEEE.;Concrete beams and girders- Gradient methods- Image enhancement- Image resolution- Imaging systems- Infrared imaging- Microscopic examination- Optical resolving power- Pixels- Restoration- Fixed pattern noise- Iterative Optimization- Nonuniformity correction- Pixel-to-pixel response- Reconstructed image- Resolution enhancement- Spatially correlated noise- Super resolution- Image reconstruction;English;Article

In particular, visible and near-infrared reflectance spectrum have offered an inexpensive way to obtain information about their mineralogical composition. In this work, near-infrared hyperspectral reflective images of several mineral samples are obtained and analyzed. The average reflective spectrum of Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), Pyrite (FeS2), Chalcocite (Cu2S), Covellite (CuS), and Slag (FeO-SiO2) packed into pellets were obtained using a near-infrared hyperspectral camera. In order to analyze copper concentrates, a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier was trained to identify its main components. A 10 fold cross validation approach was used to certify the validity of the classifier. The trained classifier provided the mineralogical spatial distribution of the different components in a concentrate sample. An automatic system controlling all the acquisition and image processing stages provides analysis of the concentrate samples. Further work is underway to include additional minerals and to improve implementation issues such as signal filtering. This is the first step towards the design of a low cost system to provide relevant information about the concentrates feeding copper smelters. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Different combustion conditions are addressed, such as sulfur-copper ratio and oxygen excess. Temperature and spectral emissivity features are estimated for each case by using the two wavelength method and radiometric models. The most relevant results have shown an increasing intensity behavior for higher sulfur-copper ratios and oxygen contents, where emissivity is almost constant along the visible spectrum range for all cases, which validates the gray body assumption. CuO and FeO emission line features along the visible spectrum appear to be a sensing alternative for describing the combustion reactions. © 2018 by the authors.

This is accomplished by means of a custom-made mid-wave infrared imager fitted with appropriate infrared optics. The microscopic thermal images enable us to capture spatial and temporal thermal information emitted from the microscopic finger pad's blood vessels and irrigation system, spatially attenuated by the finger pad's skin morphology. As a consequence, we can acquire and extract features that visual-spectrum microscopes or regular infrared imagers are not able to disclose. The thermoregulation response is acquired by exposing to a thermal stress the finger pads of voluntary subjects, while a microscopic infrared sequence was recorded. We used standard infrared imaging and signal processing techniques to extract the thermoregulation curves of the infrared sequences, and the thermal morphology features were estimated from the same imagery. One of the key findings of this paper is that three distinctive index finger pads infrared morphology patterns were identified, and important insights of the thermal behavior of the micro-spatial finger pad anatomy were observed for the very first time. © 2013 IEEE.;Blood vessels- Infrared imaging- Infrared radiation- Microscopic examination- Morphology- Optical data processing- Palmprint recognition- Thermoanalysis- Thermography (imaging)- Fingerprint Recognition- Infrared microscopy- Irrigation systems- Microscopic views- Mid wave infrared (MWIR)- Signal processing technique- Spatial morphologies- Thermal behaviors- Image processing;English;Article

The most commonly used method for AuNP synthesis in aqueous solution is the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) with trisodium citrate. We have observed variations in the pH and in the concentration of the gold colloidal suspension synthesized under standard conditions, verifying a reduction in the reaction yield by around 46% from pH 5.3 (2.4 nM) to pH 4.7 (1.29 nM). Citrate-capped AuNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, TEM, EDS, and zeta-potential measurements, revealing a linear correlation between pH and the concentration of the generated AuNPs. This result can be attributed to the adverse effect of protons both on citrate oxidation and on citrate adsorption onto the gold surface, which is required to form the stabilization layer. Overall, this study provides insight into the effect of the pH over the synthesis performance of the method, which would be of particular interest from the point of view of large-scale manufacturing processes. © 2018 by the authors.

For low-energy photons, new designs have generated new types of noise that degrade the formed-image signal-to-noise ratio to values lower than 1. Fixed-pattern noise (FPN), which is produced by the non-uniform focal-plane-array optoelectronics response, is an ill-posed problem in infrared and hyperspectral imaging science. Here, we experimentally show that the FPN behaves as an object at a depth of infinity when a light field is captured by an imaging system. The proposed method is based on the capture of the light field of a scene and digital refocusing to any nearby objects in the scene. Unlike standard techniques for FPN reduction, our method does not require knowledge of the physical parameters of the optoelectronic transducer, the motion scene, or the presence of off-line blackbody sources. The ability of the proposed method to reduce FPN is measured by evaluating the structural similarity (SSIM) index employing a blackbody-based FPN reduction technique as a reference. This new interpretation of the FPN opens avenues to create new cameras for low-energy photons with the ability to perform denoising by digital refocusing. © 2017 The Author(s).;-;English;Article

The machine vision system uses a transillumination technique to acquire images of the clam-parasite tandem. To improve the light transmission properties of the clam and parasite tissues, a novel online flattening system to flatten the clam thickness was developed. The automatic detection of the parasite in a clam is accomplished by a binary decision tree classifier that analyzes clam images. The classifier was developed using a supervised pattern-recognition approach, and proper features were created using spectral, spatial, geometrical, and biological information, such as the relative transmittance, the location of the parasite in the clam, the shape of the parasite, and the anatomical regions of the clam. The prototype system was built and tested, achieving an average classification accuracy of 98%, for a laboratory training sample set of 200 clams, and an accuracy of 73% for another set of 200 clams in an industrial setting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Algorithms simultaneously exploit the spatial and temporal information contained in an image as well as the spectral information contained at adjacent spectral images.

In this paper, using a hyperspectral imaging system in the near-infrared (NIR), hyperspectral data cubes are obtained from scanned fabric samples with gunshot residues. These fabrics have been penetrated by a bullet, where the distribution of waste released by the firearm is not homogeneous. Three samples of fabrics with GSR were used. The principal objective was to obtain particular spectral characteristics of gunshot residues. To obtain these characteristics, the reflectance spectrum for three selected pixel sets from three images of the fabric samples with GSR was built in. Each selected pixel contains only information from the residue compound and not from the fabric. The fabrics were illuminated at the same lamp power. One fabric without GSR was also characterized for comparison between the waste particles and the clean fabric itself. To compare the results, the statistical average was applied to each of the generated reflectance spectra for every set of selected pixels. The Experimental results have shown that analysis of the GSR fabric samples using hyperspectral imaging systems in the NIR spectrum allowed to characterize and compared the fabric samples with and without GSR. In particular, it is possible to establish a clear spectral difference between the fabrics with and without GSR in the wavelengths between 950 and 1350 nm.;Cybernetics- Imaging systems- Information science- Infrared imaging- Pixels- Reflection- Spectroscopy- Thermography (imaging)- Waste incineration- Gunshot residue- Hyperspectral Imaging- Hyperspectral imaging systems- Near-infrared imaging- Optoelectronic imaging- Reflectance spectrum- Spectral characteristics- Spectral differences- Infrared devices;English;Conference Paper

The model was conceived after analyzing, in the spatial frequency domain, FPN calibration data from different IR cameras and technologies. The analysis showed that the spatial patterns of the FPN are retained in the phase spectrum, while the noise intensity is determined by the magnitude spectrum. Thus, unlike traditional representations, the proposed model abstracts the FPN structure using one matrix for its magnitude spectrum and another matrix for its phase spectrum. Three applications of the model are addressed here. First, an algorithm is provided for generating random samples of the FPN with the same spatial pattern of the actual FPN. Second, the model is used to assess the performance of non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithms in the presence of spatially correlated and uncorrelated FPN. Third, the model is used to improve the NUC capability of a method that requires, as a reference, a proper FPN sample. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The method is implemented by a long-wave (8-12 [μm]) infrared microbolometer imaging array and a germanium-based infrared optical vision system adjusted to the size of a small biological sample. The enzymatic reaction is carried out by the glucokinase enzyme, which is representative of the internal dynamics of the cell. Such reactions produce a spontaneous exothermal release of energy detected by the infrared imaging system as a non-contact measurement technique. It is shown by stoichiometry computations and infrared thermal resolution metrics that the infrared imaging system can detect the energy release at the [mK] range. This allows to quantify the spontaneity of the enzymatic reaction in a three dimensional (surface and time) single and noncontact real- time measurement. The camera is characterized for disclosing its sensibility, and the fixed pattern noise is compensated by a two point calibration method. On the other hand, the glucokinase enzyme is isolated from Pyrococcus furiosus. Therefore, the experiment is carried out by manual injection with graduated micropipettes using 40 [μl] of glucokinase at the surface of the substrate contained in an eppendorf tube. For recording, the infrared camera is adjusted in-focus at 25.4 [mm] from the superficial level of the substrate.

In this paper the normalized optical transmittance of the clam and its parasite have been disclosed for the first time using a hyperspectral imaging system. It has been identified that, in the spectral band of 600-950 nm, the normalized optical transmittance of clam's mantle cavity changes in the presence or absence of the parasite. This relative change in the normalized optical transmittance has been used as an effective spectral feature for designing parasite detectors. As a proof of concept two detectors have been designed. The first detector, which relies on all the hyperspectral information, achieved a perfect detection accuracy in identifying parasite-infected clams. The second detector, which is based on a reduced number of hyperspectral bands, achieved an 85% detection accuracy.

The second metric characterizes the spectrum of the NU noise, and uses this characterization to quantify the fraction of NU noise that has been properly estimated. To test the effectiveness and consistency of the proposed metrics in assessing the NU noise, five previously reported NU correction algorithms have been ranked. To evaluate metrics's simplicity, the most computing intensive and resource demanding metric has been implemented on an inexpensive FPGA with low resource utilization. © 2013 IEEE.;Correction algorithms- Fixed pattern noise- Nonuniformity- Resource utilizations- Spatial and frequency domain- Spatial domains- Spatial similarity- Spatial structure- Infrared imaging- Optoelectronic devices;English;Conference Paper

Implementing the algorithm in hardware results in a fast, compact, low-power nonuniformity correction (NUC) system that can be embedded into an intelligent imager at a very low cost. Because it does not use an external reference, our NUC circuit works in real time during normal operation, and can track parameter drift over time. Our NUC system models NU noise as a spatially regular source of additive noise, uses a Kalman filter to estimate the offset in each detector of the array and applies an inverse model to recover the original information captured by the detector. The NUC board uses a low-cost Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S500E FPGA operating at 75MHz. The NUC circuit consumes 17.3mW of dynamic power and uses only 10% of the logic resources of the FPGA. Despite ignoring the multiplicative effects of nonuniformity, our NUC circuit reaches a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 35dB in under 50 frames, referenced to two-point calibration using black bodies. This performance lies within 0.35dB of a double-precision Matlab implementation of the algorithm. Without the bandwidth limitations currently imposed by the external RAM that stores the offset estimations, our circuit can correct 320×240-pixel video at up to 1,254 frames per second. © 2012 SPIE.;Algorithms- Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)- Hardware- Infrared devices- Kalman filters- Signal processing- VLSI circuits- Bandwidth limitation- Embedded signal processing- Infrared focal plane arrays- Multiplicative effects- Nonuniformity correction- Peak signal-to-noise ratio- Two-point calibration- VLSI- Estimation;English;Conference Paper

This is accomplished by considering an optoelectronic approach, thereby generating a more accurate mathematical representation of the hyperspectral acquisition process. The proposed model includes knowledge on the system spectral response, which can be obtained by means of an input with known spectral radiation. Further, the model also considers the dependence of the noise structure on the analog-digital conversion process, that is, schemes such as active-pixel sensor (APS) and passive-pixel sensor (PPS) have been considered. Finally, the model takes advantage of the degree of crosstalk between consecutive bands in order to determinate how much of this spectral information is contributing to the read out data obtained in a particular band. All prior knowledge is obtained by a series of experimental analysis, and then integrated into the model. After estimating the required parameters, the applicability of the multidimensional SNC is illustrated by compensating for stripping noise in hyperspectral images acquired using an experimental setup. A laboratory prototype, based on both a Photonfocus Hurricane hyperspectral camera and a Xeva Xenics NIR hyperspectral camera, has been implemented to acquire data in the range of 400-1000 [nm] and 900-1700 [nm], respectively. Also, a mobile platform has been used to simulate and synchronize the scanning procedure of the cameras and an uniform tungsten lamp has been installed to ensure an equal spectral radiance between the different bands for calibration purpose. © 2012 SPIE.;Analog-digital conversion- Fixed pattern noise- Hyper-spectral cameras- Hyper-spectral images- Hyperspectral Imaging- Mathematical representations- Optoelectronic- Striping noise- Cameras- Incandescent lamps- Pixels- Remote sensing- Spectroscopy;English;Conference Paper

The Gauss-Markov model assumed that both, the gain and the offset parameters at each detector, are random state-variables modeled by a recursive discrete-time process. For simplicity, however, we have regarded here the gain parameter as a constant and assumed that solely the offset parameter follows a Gauss-Markov model. Experiments have been conducted at room temperature and IR data was collected from black-body radiator sources using microbolometer-based IR cameras operating in the 8 to 12 μm. Next, well-known statistical techniques were used to analyze the offset time series and determinate whether the Gauss-Markov model truly fits the temporal dynamics of the offset. The validity of the Gauss-Markov model for the offset parameter was tested at two time scales: seconds and minutes. It is worth mentioning that the statistical analysis conducted in this work is a key in providing mechanisms for capturing the drift in the fixed pattern noise parameters. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;Focal plane arrays- Focusing- Gaussian distribution- Imaging systems- Infrared radiation- Markov processes- Thermography (imaging)- Black body radiator- Experimental validations- Fixed pattern noise- Gauss-Markov- Gauss-Markov models- Infrared focal plane arrays- Nonuniformity noise- Statistical techniques- Time series analysis;English;Conference Paper

Particularly, Mulinia edulis clams are susceptible to have a parasite infection caused by the isopoda Edotea magellanica, which represents a serious commercial problem commonly addressed by manual inspection. In this work a machine vision system capable of automatically detect the parasite using a clam image is presented. The parasite visualization inside the clam is achieved by an optoelectronic imaging system based on an transillumination technique. Furthermore, automatic parasite detection in the clam's image is accomplished by a pattern recognition system designed to quantitatively describe parasite candidate zones. The extracted features are used to predict the parasite presence by means of a binary decision tree classifier. A real sample dataset of more than 155000 patterns of parasite candidate zones was generated using 190 shell-off cooked clams from the Chilean south pacific coasts. This data collection was used to train a test the classifier using cross-validation. Primary results have shown a mean parasite detection rate of 85% and a mean total correct classification of 87%, which represent a substantive improvement to the existing solutions. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;Binary decision trees- clams- Cross validation- Data collection- Detection rates- Foreign object- Isopoda- Machine vision systems- Manual inspection- Optical inspection- Optoelectronic imaging system- Parasite infection- Parasite-- Real samples- Binary trees- Computer vision- Decision trees- Image processing- Optical testing- Pattern recognition- Pattern recognition systems- Systems analysis- Transillumination- Visualization- Shellfish;English;Conference Paper

To this end, different temperature profiles steering the internal temperature of the cameras have been generated, and black-body radiator sources have been employed as time and temperature constant radiation inputs. The analysis conducted over the empirical data has shown the existence of statistical correlation between camera's internal temperature and the fluctuations in the read-out data. Thus, when measurements of the internal temperature are available, effective methods for compensating the fluctuations in the read-out data can be developed.

An important issue to face up deals with the prioritization of specific zones in the study region (of high population density) with the aim of covering the most users possible. The optimization-based approach introduces directive receiving antennas along with transmitting sector antennas to make the network more realistic. Moreover, the ITU-R P.1546 propagation prediction method is used and applied to digital terrain maps (DTM) and the transmitters useful and interfering contributions are estimated at every receiver point within the region. The parameters to be optimized for every transmitter using the simulated annealing algorithm include static delays, the effective radiated power (ERP) and the relative azimuth orientation for sector antennas.

During the validation of the model, experiments conducted using an NIR hyperspectral camera have shown that, when thermal radiation is used as the camera input and no illumination is present, the output offset happens to be thermally dependent, yet independent of the wavelengths in the NIR band. In this work, the effect of the incident temperature on the amount of output offset in NIR hyperspectral cameras has been experimentally studied and introduced in our previous model for such cameras. The experimental study has been conducted using an NIR hyperspectral camera in the range of 900 to 1700 [nm] and a controlled illumination set-up, while different input temperatures have been controlled by means of black-body radiator sources. The thermal-dependent offset is modeled phenomenologically from experimental data. Initial results have shown a non-linear dependence between the offset and the temperature. This thermal-offset dependence can be used to generate new NIR hyperspectral models, new non-linear calibration procedures, and establish a basis for the study of time dependent variations of the NIR thermal-offset. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;Cameras- Hyperspectral imaging- Infrared imaging- Infrared radiation- Spectroscopy- Hyper-spectral cameras- Hyperspectral models- Input/output behaviors- NIR hyperspectral imaging- Nonlinear calibration- Physics-based modeling- Thermal offset- Time dependent variations- Infrared devices;English;Conference Paper

The algorithm estimates the continuous background based on previous information obtained from a learning database of continuous flame spectra. Then, the discontinuous flame emission is calculated by subtracting the estimated continuous baseline from the measured spectrum. The key issue subtending the learning database is that the continuous flame emissions are predominant in the sooty regions, in absence of discontinuous radiation. The proposed algorithm was tested using natural gas and bio-oil flames spectra at different combustion conditions, and the goodness-of-fit coefficient (GFC) quality metric was used to quantify the performance in the estimation process. Additionally, the commonly used first derivative method (FDM) for baseline removing was applied to the same testing spectra in order to compare and to evaluate the proposed technique. The achieved results show that the proposed method is a very attractive tool for designing advanced combustion monitoring strategies of discontinuous emissions. © 2012 Optical Society of America.;Molecular physics- Optics- Automated algorithms- Combustion condition- Combustion monitoring- Continuous flames- Estimation process- First derivative- Learning database- Spectrum techniques- Combustion;English;Article

Even though the latter assumption is convenient, it is also inaccurate due to FPN is indeed observed as a spatial pattern, with random intensity values, superimposed over the true images. In this paper, the spatial structure in both the multiplicative and the additive components of the FPN has been modeled in the frequency domain. The key observation in the proposed models is that regular spatial patterns manifest themselves as narrowband components in the magnitude spectrum of an image. Thus, the spatial structure of FPN can be abstracted in a straightforward manner by approximating the spectral response of the FPN. Moreover, the random intensity of the FPN has been also modeled by matching the empirically estimated distributions of the intensity values of both multiplicative and additive components of the FPN. Experimental characterization of FPN has been conducted using black-body radiator sources, and the theoretical as well as practical applicability of the proposed models has been illustrated by both synthesizing FPN from three different IR cameras and by proposing a simple yet effective metric to assess the amount of FPN in FPA-based cameras. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).;Black body radiator- Experimental characterization- Fixed pattern noise- Frequency domain model- Frequency domains- Infrared focal plane arrays- Intensity values- IR camera- Magnitude spectrum- Narrow bands- Spatial noise- Spatial patterns- Spatial structure- Spatially correlated noise- Spectral response- Cameras- Focusing- Frequency domain analysis- Infrared detectors- Particle beams- Photons- Random processes- Sensors- Focal plane arrays;English;Conference Paper

These algorithms rely on the spatial and temporal information available at the readout data- however, they disregard the large amount of spectral information also available at the data. In this paper such flaw has been tackled and a multidimensional approach for SNC is proposed. The main assumption of the proposed approach is the short-term stationary behavior of the spatial, spectral, and temporal input information. This assumption is justified after analyzing the optoelectronic sampling mechanism carried out by PBHCs. Namely, when the wavelength-resolution of hyperspectral cameras is high enough with respect to the target application, the spectral information at neighboring photodetectors in adjacent spectral bands can be regarded as a stationary input. Moreover, when the temporal scanning of hyperspectral information is fast enough, consecutive temporal and spectral data samples can also be regarded as a stationary input at a single photodetector. The strength and applicability of the multidimensional approach presented here is illustrated by compensating for stripping noise real hyperspectral images. To this end, a laboratory prototype, based on a Photonfocus Hurricane hyperspectral camera, has been implemented to acquire data in the range of 400-1000 [nm], at a wavelength resolution of 1.04 [nm]. A mobile platform has been also constructed to simulate and synchronize the scanning procedure of the camera.

The Correctability parameter has been evaluated by using a black body radiator and Two-Points calibration technique. Also, the Transfer Function of the microbolometer IR camera has been experimentally obtained as well as the NETD by the evaluation of radiometric data from a blackbody radiator.

As results of this analysis, Local and Global Spectral Radiation Measurements (LSRM and GSRM respectively) techniques are proposed, and guidelines for selecting the radical emission bands and spatial location of photodetectors are given. Two types of experiments have been performed in order to demonstrate the reliability of the GSRM technique for combustion characterization. In the first experiment, the LSRM and the GSRM have been implemented by using a home made sensor array, based on silicon photodiodes, for sensing the excited CH* and C2* radicals in a natural gas flame. It has been experimentally demonstrated that by using the GSRM, the signal's dispersion can be reduced to about 86% for the CH* and 76% for the C2* with respect to the obtained values with LSRM methodology. In the second experiment, the GSRM technique has been applied for sensing the CH* and C2* radicals, where it has been found that the signals emissions ratio C2*/CH* provides a good indicator of the thermal combustion efficiency and the CO pollutants emissions, with small dispersion. Thus, the GSRM technique has corroborated the usefulness of that ratio for combustion monitoring. © 2010 The Combustion Institute.;Co-pollutants- Combustion characterization- Combustion efficiencies- Combustion monitoring- Emission bands- Flame spectrum- Natural gas flames- Radiometric analysis- Silicon photodiode- Small dispersion- Spatial location- Spectral band- Spectral emission- Spectral radiation- Dispersions- Experiments- Gas emissions- Monitoring- Natural gas- Optical sensors- Optoelectronic devices- Sensor arrays- Combustion- silicon- analytic method- article- chemoluminescence- combustion- gas- priority journal- radiometry- sensor- spectroscopy;English;Article

Beyond question, a proper knowledge about the sensor response is key in this process. It is argued here that the common first order representation for hyperspectral NIR sensors does not represent accurately their thermal wavelength-dependent response, hence calling for more sophisticated and precise models. In this work, a wavelength-dependent, nonlinear model for a near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral camera is proposed based on its experimental characterization. Experiments have shown that when temperature is used as the input signal, the camera response is almost linear at low wavelengths, while as the wavelength increases the response becomes exponential. This wavelength-dependent behavior is attributed to the nonlinear responsivity of the sensors in the NIR spectrum. As a result, the proposed model considers different nonlinear input/output responses, at different wavelengths. To complete the representation, both the nonuniform response of neighboring detectors in the camera and the time varying behavior of the input temperature have also been modeled. The experimental characterization and the proposed model assessment have been conducted using a NIR hyperspectral camera in the range of 900 to 1700 [nm] and a black body radiator source. The proposed model was utilized to successfully compensate for both: (i) the nonuniformity noise inherent to the NIR camera, and (ii) the stripping noise induced by the nonuniformity and the scanning process of the camera while rendering hyperspectral images. © 2011 SPIE.;Black body radiator- Camera response- Experimental characterization- First-order representation- Fixed pattern noise- Hyper-spectral cameras- Hyper-spectral images- HyperSpectral- Hyperspectral Data- Hyperspectral Imaging- Input signal- Model assessment- Near infra red- NIR camera- NIR spectrum- Non-linear model- Nonlinear inputs- Nonuniformity- Nonuniformity noise- Responsivity- Sensor response- Spectral signal- Thermal characterization- Time varying behavior- Characterization- Infrared devices- Infrared imaging- Remote sensing- Wavelength- Cameras;English;Conference Paper

Even though this nonuniformity noise can be removed after a blackbody calibration procedure, it tends to reappear due to the intrinsic nature of infrared sensing. Online nonuniformity correction techniques have been employed for denoising and tracking the drift, also avoiding to halt normal camera operations. In this paper, a new reference-free infrared imaging quality metric is presented. The main purpose of the proposed metric is to evaluate the quality of the denoised infrared images in real-time, exchanging the typical need of calibration sources by the knowledge of the fixed-pattern noise statistics. We compare the performance of the proposed metric against standard reference-based and reference-free metrics, using a variety of real-time nonuniformity correction techniques. Results show that the new metric is able to track the nonuniformity correction performance, constantly evaluating the quality of the denoised infrared image sequences.;Blackbody calibration- Calibration source- De-noising- Fixed pattern noise- Focal planes- Image enhacement- Image quality index- Imaging quality- Infrared focal plane arrays- Infrared image sequence- Infrared images- Infrared sensing- Intrinsic nature- Nonuniformity correction- Nonuniformity noise- Calibration- Cybernetics- Image quality- Information science- Knowledge management- Infrared imaging;English;Conference Paper

In this work, we present a quantitative and comparative analysis of fixed-pattern noise reduction, or calibrating techniques, by using several image quality indexes. A special emphasis is made in demonstrating the correspondence between the reference-free (blind) image quality indexes and the typical reference-based metrics, specially when using online calibration procedures where reference data is not available. We evaluate the performance of several classic scene-based calibrating algorithms applied to: multispectral images with simulated striping noise- and infrared image sequences with simulated nonuniformity. The results show that most of the tested reference-free indexes are useful indicators for tracking some of the real degradation of the calibrated or even uncalibrated imagery, but they are far from perfect to match an error or similarity measure if the clean or reference data is available. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.;Common features- Comparative analysis- Fixed pattern noise- Grid-like- HyperSpectral- Infra-red cameras- Infrared image sequence- Multispectral images- Nonuniformity- On-line calibration- Quality indices- Quantitative evaluation- Reference data- Scene-based- Similarity measure- Striping noise- Comparative analysis- Fixed pattern noise- Infra-red cameras- Infrared image sequence- Multispectral images- On-line calibration- Quantitative evaluation- Similarity measure- Acoustic noise measurement- Computer vision- Image quality- Imaging systems- Infrared imaging- Calibration- Hyperspectral imaging- Image analysis- Image processing- Image quality- Imaging systems- Infrared imaging- Noise abatement- Quality control- Image matching- Pattern recognition;English;Conference Paper

Such a filter was derived assuming an estimation time-window short enough so that the offset NU can be regarded as a constant corrupted by additive noise. In this paper, the assumption on the stationarity of the offset NU noise has been relaxed by characterizing the dynamics of the offset NU using a Gauss-Markov random process. Based upon this model, a recursive filter that uses blocks of IR data to estimate the offset NU has been derived. A rigorous theoretical analysis of the filter has been conducted in order to provide expressions for appropriately selecting the parameters of the filter. The ability of the block-recursive filter to compensate for NU noise has been tested using raw IR videos from different IR cameras. In addition, the filter has been implemented and tested on-line in a prototype spectrally tunable IR camera. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The current process involves the physical storing and shipping of magnetic disks to these centers, where up to 5 days are needed for transportation. The need of a fast turnaround opened a new research line where all the collected data of observing radiotelescope stations is sent over the Internet. This technique is called eVLBI. Ideally the station is part of a National Research and Education Network (NREN) where multiple intercontinental routes are available. Under this scenario a new protocol has been developed which allows multiple parallel data flows with important throughput improvements. The unique properties of VLBI data imply the development of a custom load control based on user datagram protocol (UDP).

The method is based on the optical analysis of the flame by using a Silicon Photodiodes array and a set of interference optical filters. The covered wavelengths evaluate the formation and behaviour of excited CH* and C2* radicals for confined gas flames. The monitoring of these radicals is carried out in the flame reaction region at the burner exit, where the C2*/CH* ratio signals provide enough information to identify the optimal fuel-air ratio in order to obtain the boiler maximal efficiency and to prevent an incomplete combustion. The experimental results obtained for two power levels, in a boiler of 150 kW, demonstrate that the C2*/CH* ratio provides important information concerningthe combustion state and gives a clear indication about the burner adjustment when CO emissions begin to increase to the upper the levels accepted by environmental laws. The fast response and its non-intrusive character give to the proposed optical sensor an important potential to be used in advanced control strategies for the on-line optimization of the combustion process.;Air- Boilers- Carbon monoxide- Emission spectroscopy- Environmental regulations- Flammability- Gases- Heat exchangers- Heat transfer- Monitoring- Optical filters- Optical sensors- Optimization- Petroleum refineries- Photodiodes- Sensors- Smoke- Thermoanalysis- Thermochemistry- Advanced control strategies- CO emissions- Combustion pro cess- Combustion state- Environmental laws- Fast response- Flame spectrum- Fuel-air ratios- Gas- Gas flames- Incomplete combustions- Measuring methods- Non-intrusive- Non-intrusive methods- On-line optimizations- Optical analysis- Optical sensor- Optimal combustions- Power levels- Combustion;English;Conference Paper

Such a filter was derived considering an estimation time-window short enough so that the offset NU can be regarded as a constant in noise. Since the offset NU is non-stationary, upon the arrival of new blocks of IR data new estimates of the offset NU have to be computed. In this paper, this recursive filter is extended by adding to the so-called intra-block processing (where offset NU is a constant) an inter-block processing algorithm. The inter-block processing algorithm considers the time varying effect in the offset NU and models it as a discrete-time Gauss-Markov random process. So, the extended filter is designed to compensate continuously for the NU when new blocks of frames arrive. In addition, the theoretical analysis of the estimator provides us expressions for selecting the appropriate parameters required by the algorithm. The ability of the method to compensate for the offset NU is demonstrated by employing several mid-wavelength IR video sequences. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;Digital image storage- Electric network analysis- Feature extraction- Focusing- Image analysis- Imaging systems- Infrared imaging- Optoelectronic devices- Pattern recognition- Photography- Random processes- Recursive functions- Thermography (imaging)- Video recording- And models- Appropriate parameters- Block processing- Estimation times- Image sequence processing- Infrared focal plane arrays- Infrared imaging systems- IR datums- Markov random processes- Non uniformities- Nonuniformity correction method- Recursive filtering- Recursive filters- Theoretical analyses- Time varying- Video sequences- Wave filters;English;Conference Paper

The infrared spectra contains the heat energy emitted by a face and it naturally present an insensitive behavior to variations in illuminations. Infrared imaging system can be formed by a Focal-Plane-Array technology, a group of photodetectors located in the focal plane of an imaging systems, but inherently present the nonuniformity as fixed-pattern noise that degrades the quality of infrared images. Additionally, this nonuniformity slowly varies over time, and depending on the technology used, this drift can take from minutes to hours. Due to this, the face identification performance is degraded over time, requiring a continuous-time calibrations method in order to maintain the face recognition rate using infrared imaging system. In synthesis, this work focuses on the evaluation of the degradation in pattern recognition performance produced by the fixed-pattern noise and the improvement when nonuniformity correction techniques is applied. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.;Computer vision- Continuous time systems- Focusing- Image enhancement- Imaging systems- Infrared imaging- Thermography (imaging)- Correlation filters- Face identification- Face recognition rates- Fixed pattern noise- Focal plane array technologies- Infrared spectrum- Non-uniformities- Nonuniformity correction- Face recognition;English;Conference Paper

The FPN refers to the inability of the photodetectors in the focal-plane array to render a uniform output image when a uniform-intensity scene is being imaged. We present a noise-cancellation-based algorithm that compensates for the additive component of the FPN. The proposed method relies on the assumption that a source of noise correlated to the additive FPN is available to the IR camera. An important feature of the algorithm is that all the calculations are reduced to a simple equation, which allows for the bias compensation of the raw imagery. The algorithm performance is tested using real IR image sequences and is compared to some classical methodologies. © 2008 Optical Society of America.;Focusing- Infrared imaging- Spurious signal noise- Algorithm performance- Classical methodologies- Fixed pattern noise- Important features- Infrared focal plane arrays- IR image sequences- Noise cancellation- Nonuniformity correction algorithm- Signal denoising;English;Article

For a nonconfined oil flame, the sensor responses for the axial intensity were highly correlated with the measurements obtained with a radiometer. For confined gas flames the ratio between the signal corresponding to C2* and CH"" was successfully correlated with the CO pollutant emissions and the combustion efficiency.

The estimator is optimal in the least-square error sense and estimates the offset NU using only the collected scene data. Our scene-based nonuniformity correction (NUC) method exploits Kalman's theory in order to estimate a constant in noise. The method is based upon two key assumptions: (i) the input irradiance at each detector is assumed to be a random variable uniformly distributed in a range that is common to all detectors in the IR-FPA- and (ii) the IR data sequences considered are temporally short enough such that the offset NU at each pixel of the array remains constant within the sequence. The proposed algorithm iterates over the frames in a pixel-by-pixel basis and updates two filter parameters for each pixel over the IR-FPA. Additionally, an on-line technique for ghosting artifacts cancellation is introduced to the NUC filter and an index to assess the artifact reduction is developed. The ability of the method to compensate for the offset NU is demonstrated by filtering video sequences from mid- and long-wave IR cameras. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It is an adaptive transform based on the application of independent component analysis to the RGB data of an entire color image. The result is a linear and reversible color space transform that provides three new coordinate axes where the projected data is as much as statistically independent as possible, and therefore highly uncorrelated. Compared to many non-linear color space transforms such as the HSV or CIE-Lab, the proposed one has the advantage of being a linear transform from the RGB color space, much like the XYZ or YIQ. However, its adaptiveness has the drawback of needing an estimate of the transform matrix for each image, which is sometimes computationally expensive for larger images due to the common iterative nature of the independent component analysis implementations. Then, an image subsampling method is also proposed to enhance the novel color space transform speed, efficiency and robustness. The new color space is used for a large set of test color images, and it is compared to traditional color space transforms, where we can clearly visualize its vast potential as a promising tool for segmentation purposes for example. © 2007 SPIE-TS&T.;Independent component analysis- Mathematical transformations- Robustness (control systems)- Color space transform- Image subsampling method- Linear transform- Transform matrix- Color image processing;English;Conference Paper

Both raw maps and optimal signal images in the (u, v)-plane and the sky plane show strong detections of the E mode (11.7 σ for the EE power spectrum overall) and no detection of the B mode. The power spectra are used to constrain parameters of the flat tilted adiabatic ACDM models: those determined from EE and TE bandpowers agree with those from TT, which is a powerful consistency check. There is little tolerance for shifting polarization peaks from the TT-forecast locations, as measured by the angular sound crossing scale 0 = 100/ls= 1.03 ± 0.02 from EE and TE- compare with 1.044 ± 0.005 with the TT data included.

Actually, several nonuniformity correction methods perform correction of nonuniformities by means of gain and offset estimation in a detector-by-detector basis using several approach such as laboratory calibration methods, registration-based algorithm, and algebraic and statistical scene-based algorithm. Some statistical algorithms model the slow and random drift in time that the gain and offset present in many practical FPA applications by means of Gauss-Markov model, assuming that the gain and offset are uncorrelated. Due to this, in this work we present a study and model of such correlation by means of a generalized Gauss-Markov model. The gain and offset model-based correlation is validate using several infrared video sequences. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.;Algorithms- Focal plane arrays- Imaging systems- Mathematical models- Signal processing- Gauss-Markov model- Image sequence processing- Nonuniformity gain- Offset parameters- Sensor arrays;English;Conference Paper

The proposed NUC method compensates for the additive component of the FPN statistically processing the read-out signal using a noise-cancellation system. The main assumption of the method is that a source of noise correlated to the additive noise of the IRFPA is available to the system. Under this assumption, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is designed to synthesize an estimate of the additive noise. Moreover, exploiting the fact that the assumed source of noise is constant in time, we derive a simple expression to calculate the estimate of the additive noise. Finally, the estimate is subtracted to the raw IR imagery to obtain the corrected version of the images. The performance of the proposed system and its ability to compensate for the FPN are tested with infrared images corrupted by both real and simulated nonuniformity.;Additive noise- Algorithms- FIR filters- Infrared imaging- Sensors- Fixed-pattern noise- Noise-cancellation system- Nonuniformity correction- Focal plane arrays;English;Conference Paper

The analysis assumes nanosecond gated-mode operation of the SPADs and that band-to-band tunneling of carriers is the dominant source of dark current in the multiplication region. The model is then utilized to optimize the SPQE as a function of the applied voltage, for a given operating temperature and multiplication-region structure and material. The model can be applied to SPADs with In0.52Al0.48As or InP multiplication regions as well as In0.52 Al0.48As-InP heterojunction multiplication regions for wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55μm. The predictions show that the SPQE generally decreases with decreasing the multiplication-region thickness. Moreover, an InP multiplication region requires a lower breakdown electric field (and, hence, offers a higher SPQE) than that required by an In0.52 Al0.48 As layer of the same width. The model also shows that the fractional width of the In0.52 Al0.48 As layer in an In0.52 Al0.48 InP heterojunction multiplication region can be optimized to attain a maximum SPQE that is greater than that offered by an InP multiplication region. This effect becomes more pronounced in thin multiplication regions as a result of the increased significance of dead space. © 2005 IEEE.;Electric fields- Electric potential- Heterojunctions- Impact ionization- Optimization- Probability- Quantum efficiency- Semiconducting indium phosphide- Avalanche photodiodes (APDs)- Breakdown probability- Dark count- Dead space- Detection efficiency- Geiger mode- Single-photon detection- Avalanche diodes;English;Article

The proposed algorithm is based on using a bank of Kalman filters in parallel. Each filter independently estimates state variables comprising the gain and the bias matrices of the sensor, according to its own dynamic-model parameters. The supervising component of the algorithm then generates the final estimates of the state variables by forming a weighted superposition of all the estimates rendered by each Kalman filter. The weights are computed and updated iteratively, according to the a posteriori-likelihood principle.

This analysis gives a clear view of the contribution of each lifter face to the torque and power.

This power is compared to the power released by the DEM software and the power obtained from the strain gauge installed in the pilot mill. Results show an almost perfect matching between the power from the lifters forces and the DEM power, and a small error compared to the measured torque and power.

Hence, any improvement in the energy use of this process will have an important impact on production costs. Paper presents the results of an extensive testing program to determine the effect of lifter wear on the power demanded by the grinding mill. Selected power-speed curves covering up to 110% of critical speed are reported. Using these results, a lifter wear factor is proposed to include this effect on the power demand expressions of grinding mills. Results show that for dry grinding, as the lifters wear, the power needed for a specific operating condition increases. Using these results, mill operators will have an important piece of information to set the best operating point for an efficient ore comminution and efficient energy consumption. It will also help to define the appropriate date for a liner change. © 2017 IEEE.;Ball milling- Energy utilization- Grinding (comminution)- Grinding (machining)- Mining- Software testing- Testing- Comminution process- Dry grinding- Extensive testing- Liner wear- Mining operations- Mining process- Operating condition- Sag mills- Ball mills;English;Article

One very important charge condition that can produce a catastrophic failure during the starting of grinding mills is the compacting of the load inside the mill, especially after long downtimes. This condition is usually named frozen charge. The load remains locked to the mill shell and after a half-turn drops damaging the mill body and bearings. Therefore, the mill protection system must give an early detection of this condition and abort the start before the compacted mill charge falls hitting the bottom of the mill shell. This paper presents the development of a robust estimation and protection algorithm of locked charge condition based on drive and process signals. The proposed algorithm includes a locked charge model that permits to define torque, root mean square (rms) current, and power thresholds for the existing starting charge conditions, and compares the locked charge signals to the online estimation of drive variables. This comparison is used to detect the beginning of charge cascading and the threshold values are used to command the termination of the start-up. Proposed algorithm was evaluated using field records of an 8.2 MW semiautogenous mill drive confirming its ability to handle startups with different charge conditions. © 2017 IEEE.;Ball milling- Grinding (machining)- Locks (fasteners)- Mineral industry- Synchronous motors- Catastrophic failures- Critical equipment- locked charge- Mining concentrator plants- On-line estimation- Protection algorithms- Protection systems- semiautogenous (SAG) mill- Ball mills;English;Article

Economy-scale has motivated the use of high capacity semiautogenous (SAG) mill units whose continuous operation is essential to mine profitability. Hence, the development of modeling tools of SAG mill drive systems that help to analyze and prevent costly long-time outages, are of great benefit. This paper presents the development of phase and qd space vector models of the 2-stator winding synchronous motor used in SAG mill drives. Using a space vector rotation transformation, the two shifted stator winding are modeled as an equivalent 1-stator winding. Combining these motor models to two 6-pulse, one 12-pulse, and one ideal cycloconverters, three space models of the complete drive system are developed. The space vector models are evaluated during a normal stop sequence of an 8.2-MW SAG mill drive. The stop sequence includes a decelerating ramp, a holding torque, and a rollback triangular reference.

This paper proposes algorithms for the evaluation of loss motor components and the flux level that produces the minimum-loss operating condition, covering the whole constant-torque operating region. Both scalar and vector drives are considered, although it is found that the operation of scalar- and vector-controlled drives with optimum flux (or d-axis current) gives very similar results for the same operating points. Evaluation is done using four induction motors of 4, 11, 55, and 110 kW. Results confirm that important savings can be achieved, especially in applications where motors operate with high speed and low to moderate load torque.

To obtain an accurate representation of the dynamic behavior of the mill charge, especially during the first half turn of the SAG mill, a dynamic model of the mill charge is developed. This dynamic model uses the radius and angle position of the mill charge center of mass. The dynamic angle is obtained from starting field records. First, a typical starting is evaluated using the three modeling options, comparing the computational requirements of each evaluation. Then, the effect of the charge volume and the effect of the initial ball charge are presented. Finally, results are compared to field records for three different starts of an 8.2-MW SAG mill, and the effect of the shutdown time period is analyzed. © 2014 IEEE.;AC-AC power converters- Dynamic models- Electric windings- Minerals- Plant shutdowns- Stators- Torque- Winding- Center of mass- Computational model- Computational requirements- Dynamic behaviors- Load modeling- Sag mills- Sinusoidal signals- Steady state- Synchronous motors;English;Article

Box 160-C, Concepción, Chile;Shovels play a key role in surface mining operations. Keeping the shovel payload inside the limits defined by manufacturers will reduce mechanical components wear and overheating of electric drive train components. This paper presents and evaluates two online estimation algorithms of shovel payload based exclusively on shovel drive signals. Proposed algorithms use a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) structure based on a 3-dof integrated mechanical-electrical model of an ac drive rope shovel. The developed estimators based on the hoist and swing drives signals are evaluated first using an idealized truck loading cycle, and then using field signals of a production mining shovel, showing fast and accurate cross checked values. Having this information, operators will be able of operating their equipments inside the safety boundaries and avoid overloading the mining trucks. © 2015 IEEE.;AC motors- Electric drives- Estimation- Mine trucks- Mining- Mining equipment- Trucks- AC drives- Cable shovels- Electric drive train- Electrical modeling- Mechanical components- Model reference adaptive system- Online estimation algorithm- payload- Shovels;English;Conference Paper

Box 160-C, Concepción, Chile;One very important charge condition that can produce a catastrophic failure during the starting of grinding mills is the compacting of the load inside the mill, especially after long downtimes. This condition is usually named frozen load and the load remains locked to the mill shell and after a half turn drops damaging the mill body and bearings. Therefore, the mill protection system must give an early detection of this condition and aborts the start before the compacted mill charge falls hitting the bottom of the mill shell. Actual protection schemes against locked load use fix torque or current trip values and do not consider the effect of the specific charge inside the mill on each startup. This paper presents the development of a robust estimation and protection algorithm of locked load condition based on drive and process signals. The proposed algorithm includes a locked load model used to define torque, rms current and power thresholds for the existing starting charge conditions, and compares the locked load signals to the online estimation of drive variables. This comparison is used to detect the beginning of charge cascading, and the threshold values are used to command the starting abortion. Main advantage of the proposed protection algorithm is that considers the effect of the mill charge and charge position, and therefore gives an accurate and safe detection of locked load for any charge condition during the mill starting. Proposed algorithm was evaluated using field records of an 8.2 MW semi-autogenous (SAG) mill drive confirming its ability to handle startups with different charge conditions. © 2015 IEEE.;Algorithms- Grinding (machining)- Grinding mills- Signal detection- Synchronous motors- Catastrophic failures- On-line estimation- Power thresholds- Protection algorithms- Protection schemes- Protection systems- Robust estimation- Sag mills- Locks (fasteners);English;Conference Paper

Box 160-C, Concepción, Chile;Mineral grinding is one of the most important and critical stages in copper mining. Economy-scale has motivated the use of high capacity semi-autogenous (SAG) mill units whose continuous operation is essential to mine profitability. Hence, the development of modeling tools of SAG mill drive systems that help to analyze and prevent costly longtime outages, are of great benefit. Paper presents the development of phase and qd space vector models of the 2-stator winding synchronous motor used in SAG mill drives. Using a space vector rotation transformation the two shifted stator winding are modeled as an equivalent 1-stator winding. Combining these motor models to two 6-pulse, one 12-pulse, and one ideal cycloconverters, three space models of the complete drive system are developed. The space vector models are evaluated during a normal stop sequence of an 8.2 MW SAG mill drive. The stop sequence includes a decelerating ramp, a holding torque and a rollback triangular reference. Results show that the developed models are powerful and precise tools that allow the evaluation of the SAG mill drive system during any dynamic or transient event. © 2015 IEEE.;AC-AC power converters- Synchronous motors- Vector spaces- Vectors- Winding- Continuous operation- Developed model- Holding torque- Mill shutdown- Modeling tool- Sag mills- Stator winding- Transient events- Plant shutdowns;English;Conference Paper

This paper proposes algorithms for the evaluation of loss power components, and the flux level that produces minimum loss operating condition, covering the whole constant torque operating region. Both scalar and vector drives are considered, although it is found that the operation of scalar and vector controlled drives with optimum flux (or d-axis current) gives very similar results for the same operating points. Evaluation is done using four induction motors of 4 kW, 11 kW, 55 kW, and 110 kW. Results confirm that important savings can be achieved, especially in applications where motors operate with high speed and low to moderate load torque.

A commanded air-gap torque and flux can be achieved by the end of each pulse width modulation (PWM) period using the DB-DTFC. However, it may take several PWM periods to achieve a desired torque that is physically infeasible in one step when operating near the voltage limit. The large torque command can be shaped as a feasible trajectory so that the deadbeat torque and flux is achieved for every sample time instant (switching period) along the trajectory. In this paper, the feasible trajectory is dynamically optimized to achieve a large torque command in the shortest time during the voltage-limited and current-limited operation. A loss-minimizing stator flux linkage is used during steady-state operation to reduce the computational complexity of the dynamic optimization and to operate the IPMSM at the loss-minimizing condition.

The experimental validation is performed on test benches. A rotor bar is expressly damaged from a small value to completely cut, and then each technique performance in the detection of the problem was evaluated. The mechanical vibration analysis showed to require a substantially higher damage level than the two other techniques to detect the problem. In this case, the technique based on instantaneous angular speed showed to be the most incipient of the three, as it was able to detect damage as small as porosities in the bars.;Current analysis- Damage level- Experimental validations- Instantaneous angular speed- Rotor bars- Squirrel cage rotors- Test benches- Induction motors- Vibration analysis;Spanish;Article

It is appropriate to note that these drives have the capability to be used as a built-in sensor to estimate important characteristics of the mechanical system. The techniques to do this proposed in this paper do not require any change in the motor drive sensors, and can be performed in real time during continuously changing conditions. By estimating the states of each element as a function of its position, spatial synchronous averaging can be used on each element to identify its unique characteristics, including deterioration. This paper presents the development and evaluation of these technologies, and an exploration of the limitations of the proposed technologies. © 2012 IEEE.;Electric motor drives- Gear transmissions- In-vehicle- Mechanical systems- Motor drive- Real time- Synchronous averaging- Track deterioration- Traction applications- Traction drive- Deterioration- Electric drives- Energy conversion- Exhibitions- Power transmission- Sensors;English;Conference Paper

This paper evaluates the effect of the condensate during the starting of a dryer section using the experimental curves reported by several authors, as well as a dimensionless model of the input power as a function of the condensate quantity and roll velocity. Through the evaluation of a nine-cylinder dryer section for various condensate quantities and varying number of cylinders containing condensate, a comparison is made to the power requirements of several actual paper machine dryer sections undergoing various starting procedures. These comparisons indicate that if the percent condensate (condensate volume/full cylinder volume} × 100) in the range of 0.5%-1%, or greater, is nominally assumed to be present, then the sizing of the section drive capacity must take into consideration the additional indrive load resulting from this condensate.

This paper presents and evaluates three thermal models that are capable of detecting the effect of the pulp in the dissipation of the operating losses to the ambient. One model is a simple third-order model, whose frame-to-ambient resistance is affected by the presence of pulp partially blocking the air inlet. The other two models recognize the asymmetrical dissipation produced by the pulp coating the upper sector of the motor frame by defining flow paths for the different radial quarters of the motor. Through an extensive testing program, the effects of the different pulp situations on the quarter and/or equivalent thermal resistances are determined. Using these values, the temperature rises in the spot of interest using the proposed models are evaluated, showing excellent agreement with the experimental values.

There are important challenges that must be addressed before ELS can be implemented. Asynchronous sampling between drives will cause perceived distortion, which negatively affects the degree of motion and tension control available. Relative-state motion control requires high position information resolution to be able to accurately measure and correct for small differences in motion between shafts. In addressing these issues, ELS can be implemented correctly to achieve much more precise tension and speed control in paper machines. The asynchronism between drive sampling frequencies is addressed using a novel observer-based compensation mechanism. This method is shown to work in both simulation and experimentation. The resolution of motion information is increased using a sine/cosine encoder in conjunction with an optical-signal-tracking observer. The improvements are shown both in simulation and experimentation. © 2010 IEEE.;Asynchronous sampling- Compensation mechanism- Control methodology- Digital control- Digital implementation- Line-shaft- Motion information- Motion measurements- Motor drive- Paper machine- Position information- Sampling frequencies- Tension controls- Digital control systems- Electric drives- Measurements- Mining- Motion control- Motion planning;English;Article

Due to the rectangular slot geometry, stator teeth present a trapezoidal geometry with small tooth width close to the shaft, increasing as the diameter becomes larger. This fact introduces an uneven airgap flux distribution if a constant flux source, such as rectangular PM, is utilized to magnetize the machine. As a result, flux density over the stator tooth becomes irregular, inductance parameters are a function of the stator diameter and saliency varies according to machine load. All these effects degrade machine power capability for low and rated load. In this paper, a novel axial flux PM machine with tangential magnetization is presented.

As the heat transfer is highly dependent on the air speed and turbulence, separate evaluations are done in four axial sectors of four different frames. For each frame, each sector is thermally isolated and evenly heated by an internal cylindrical heater with controlled losses. The experimental results allow computing the local transfer coefficient on each axial sector in terms of the fin dimensions and cooling air velocity, and using these empirical coefficients, it is possible to evaluate the thermal capability of the frames and/or to compute the temperature gradient needed to dissipate certain losses. Based on these results, a simple and accurate method to size finned frames is proposed. © 2008 IEEE.;Cooling- Fins (heat exchange)- Heat exchangers- Heat transfer- Heating equipment- Motors- Speed- Thermoanalysis- Accurate- Air speeds- Computing- Cooling airs- Cooling fans- Cylindrical heaters- Different velocities- Empirical coefficients- Fin dimensions- Heat transfer capabilities- Local transfers- Paper addresses- Speed motors- Temperature gradients- Thermal design- Thermal evaluation- Air;English;Article

This torque is proportional to the PM flux and the reluctance variation, and is independent of the load current. In this paper, two methods for cogging torque reduction in an axial PM machine with field weakening capability are presented. The machine's rotor configuration considers two sections: one PM pole that provides the field excitation and one iron section in charge of providing low d-axix reluctance. Significant reduction of the cogging effects is achieved by adjusting stator geometry and rotor pole configuration. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis is used to demonstrate these improvements. Conclusions and design recommendations are presented for a 5-kW eight-pole PM machine prototype under construction. © 2007 IEEE.;Computer simulation- Finite element method- Rotors- Stators- Torque- Vibrations (mechanical)- Excited states- Poles- Rotors (windings)- Axial flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machine- Cogging torque reduction- Permanent magnets- Axial flux- Axial flux PM machines- Cogging torque- Cogging torque reductions- Design recommendations- Field excitations- Field-weakening- Permanent-magnet machine;English;Article

The estimators consider all the essential dynamic, friction, and inertial variation effects. Both estimators are evaluated in typical trapezoidal winder operating cycles.

With this segmented intercell configuration the resilience to anomalies is improved by reducing short-circuit occurrence and their magnitude. Anomalies are pinpointed in 60 s with the addition of light mass secondary connectors placed on the capping board. Moreover, the new topology is capable of surpassing anomalies even without assistance to sustain production.

For 9 hours, the highly irradiated desert of Chile produces PV at half the price compared to that generated from fossil fuels. A major challenge for the mining industry is to take advantage of it. However, the design concept for the equipment was to operate with carbon-based energy 24-hour flat-price. Moreover, since electrical energy used to be more expensive, these plants operate with small inter-electrode distances to reduce electrical consumption. They also require oil-heated exchangers to supplement the electrolyte heat required by the process. Now, during the 9 hour low PV price scenario a larger process current should be enough for electrolyte heating. To complement the heat required a solution is remove some electrodes per cell. Results indicate that the heat storage capacity of the electrolyte is enough to keep a semi-constant temperature throughout the day. Moreover, there are various advantages of larger electrode spacing: higher short circuit impedance, lower cathode-currents dispersion and, lower sensitivity to electrode misalignments and contact resistances dispersion. A 3D FEM fed with industrial data predicts the results. A discussion of the positive-negative effects on the copper deposit current efficiency and energy consumption is included. Finally as an example, the paper calculates the inter-electrode distance required to eliminate the oil-heated external exchanger for a copper cathode electro winning plant of 240,000 tons / year. © 2018 IEEE.;Cathodes- Copper deposits- Digital storage- Dispersions- Energy utilization- Finite element method- Fossil fuels- Heat storage- Constant temperature- Copper electrowinning- Electrical consumption- Electrode distances- Electrode spacing- Electrolyte heating- Heat storage capacity- Short-circuit impedance- Electrolytes;English;Conference Paper

The electrochemical kinetics of cells is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition allows enhancing cathode quality, electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, early identification of temperature excursions, and electrolyte flow blockages. Abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation, higher energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, and safety issues because the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations. With real-time information about electrolyte variables, it is possible to provide early warnings to face the wide variability of cell performance and safety conditions caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a noninvasive wireless sensor for monitoring the electrolyte temperature inside cells and estimates the electrolyte circulation flow through each cell simultaneously. The sensor design is suitable to highly corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition-monitoring sensor proposed is small in size, lightweight, and meets battery-free operation and nonsparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a radio frequency-link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation not suitable for electrolytic process monitoring. © 1972-2012 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Cathodes- Condition monitoring- Copper- Electrolytic cells- Energy utilization- Monitoring- Process monitoring- Production- Temperature measurement- Temperature sensors- Condition monitoring sensors- Electrochemical kinetics- Electrolyte circulations- Electrolyte temperature- Electrolytic process- Harsh environment- Harsh environment sensor- Wireless sensor- Electrolytes;English;Article

Currently, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness of belt conveyors (availability, utilization & load-factor) is a major concern for mining operators. The downtime of overland conveyors leads to the stoppage of bulk material handling, disrupting ore extraction and material processing. Root Cause Analysis shown that failures of rotating components such as idlers are the main responsible for unplanned shutdowns. Idler rollers are relatively simple and low reasonable running cost. However, their reliability has a large impact on the performance of long overland conveyors due to their large amount in service along the system (up to 26,500 idler rollers for a 10 km conveyor). The idler roller failures are stochastic. There is uncertainty in predicting its location, severity and time of occurrence. Since bearings have a limited lifespan, and a very large amount of idlers are operating under different conditions in a harsh environment, it is possible to estimate that a significant number of idler rollers are close to the fault condition, anytime. To meet cost per ton targets and zero harm goals, while reduce unplanned downtime, operators are installing different on-line condition based monitoring systems to continuously check on the health and provide early warning on problems with idler rollers. But, the deployment of idler monitoring systems presents several challenges in mining environments that must be addressed.

Equipotential intercell bars are made of a large continuous copper busbar conductor to receive the cathode currents from one cell, rebalance the potential of the electrodes, and split the current to the next cell anodes. The potential balance by the bar itself produces undesirable side circulating currents with respective extra power losses at electrode contacts and throughout the copper busbar. This Joule heating collateral effect increases the busbar temperatures, the corrosion rates, and the electrical resistivity when copper annealed. This phenomenon is present on industrial sites. Using 3-D multiphysics finite-element methods tuned with industrial parameters, this study produces a scientific answer for this phenomenon. For describing the side effects of the potential reset, the concept of circulating current is developed and presented. This concept resembles reactive currents and its effects in power systems. In short, it explains why equipotential busbars exhibit and suffer higher overheating and accelerated corrosion rates. By contrast, its current source counterpart's bars are free of circulating currents and overheating. Finally, industrial measurements are included to support the results. © 2016 IEEE.;Busbars- Copper- Corrosion- Corrosion rate- Electrodes- Energy utilization- Accelerated corrosion- Circulating current- Collateral effects- Electrical analysis- Industrial measurements- Intercell- Series configuration- THREE-DIMENSIONAL FEM- Finite element method;English;Article

This work presents an intercell topology composed by a busbar, a capping board and secondary connectors placed on top. Resilience to anomalies is improving by reducing the occurrence and fast recovery from outlasting anomalies.

Two intercell technologies for designing these busbars are presently available: current source (CS) or voltage source. For this research project, we selected CS based on tankhouse operational data that consistently show better performance than its counterpart. Both technologies can be implemented in dogbone or central busbar configurations. Dogbone was chosen because of the better contact distance and larger heatsink area. The proposed design ensures hot swapability. Conventional busbars suffer premature aging, corrosion, and contact deterioration. Industrial samples show these phenomena.

The actual physical condition of the plate, hanger bar assembly, and the internal resistance of electrodes are critical factors in this process. Internal electrode resistances affect parallel anode-cathode pair resistances. Therefore, it also alters balanced copper deposits, current efficiency, and cell voltage and power consumption of electrowinning cells. This paper summarizes the design characteristics of commercial stainless steel cathodes and cold-rolled lead-alloy anodes. It includes the evaluation of electrode performances under typical operating conditions using 3-D finite-element method analysis. The proposed evaluation of internal electrode resistance comprises nonlinear effects of electrical conduction, heat generation, and electrode position. The analysis of the design robustness of electrodes considers the most important elements, which help to maintain high current efficiency and electrical performance in the long term- that is to say, mechanical strength, inherent straightness, resistance to dissolution of copper coating on hanger bars, galvanic corrosion of weld joints, and hanger bar resistance to annealing. Results are based on industrial measurements, test work by vendors, and tankhouse operating data for benchmarking. The performance evaluation considers internal electrical resistance, contact shape design, contact loading, average contact resistance, and lifetime current efficiency.

The electrochemical kinetics of electrolytic processes is inherently dependent on these electrolyte variables. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte condition integrated to operation and housekeeping procedures, allows enhancing cathode quality and electrodeposition time, better utilization of electrolyte additives, and early identification of temperature excursions and electrolyte flow blockages. These abnormal cell conditions can produce excessive evaporation and energy consumption, anode passivation that impair cathode production in copper electrorefining, or safety issues from the production of flammable hydrogen in copper electrowinning. Therefore, the monitoring of changes in temperature and electrolyte flow can give critical indicators of process deviations and providing early warnings to face the wide variability of performance and safety conditions of cells caused by electrolyte condition mismanagement. This paper proposes a non-invasive wireless sensor for the monitoring of the temperature and electrolyte circulation flow estimation through each cell, suitable to highly-corrosive sulfuric acid environments. The condition monitoring sensor design is small size, lightweight, meets battery-free operation and non-sparking safety requirements. It uses an inductive link-based system for powering and a RF link for communicating. The result is a sensor that surpasses the features of standard instrumentation currently used for electrolytic process monitoring. © 2016 IEEE.;Accident prevention- Cathodes- Condition monitoring- Copper- Electric batteries- Electrodes- Electrolytic cells- Energy utilization- Monitoring- Process monitoring- Production- Battery-free operations- Condition monitoring sensors- Electrochemical kinetics- Electrolyte circulations- Electrolytic process- Harsh environment- Harsh environment sensor- Wireless sensor- Electrolytes;English;Conference Paper

Specifically, mine shovel operation is frequently disrupted by energy quality issues. A number of alternative approaches to deal with this problem include: the use of reactive power compensator technologies (i.e. passive filters- electronically switched capacitor banks and static VAR compensators), imposing limits to mining cable lengths, increasing cross sections of the surface cables and increasing the power of mobile substations. However, for this industrial site those alternatives fail to obtain the desired power quality and are not compatible with a potential expansion of the mine pit. This paper presents a solution based on IEEE recommended practices by adding a new feeder with higher rated voltage to the mine loop. The result is better shovel availability, a reduction in arc flash risk and a 9.55% improvement in energy efficiency.

Some key performance indicators include: control and balance of the cathodic current densities, short circuit protection and bypass of weak contacts. Further, it has the unique property of hot-swapability for replacing impaired connectors.

These include electrode positioning capping boards and 3-D grids, electrode spacers, and segmented intercell bars. This paper introduces a design concept to avoid electrode open circuits and reduce contact resistances. The design is based on a female tooth shape for the contacts on the intercell bar. This leads to improved electrode alignment, reduced contact resistances, easier contact cleaning, and ensured electrical contact for the electrodes. It results in lower operational temperature for the electrodes, reduced plant housekeeping, increased lifespan for capping boards, and higher rate of grade A copper production. The comparative results presented should be a useful guideline for any type of intercell bar. Improvements in production levels and energy efficiency should reach 0.5% and 3%, respectively.

Design Three existing active learning algorithms (distance-based (DIST), diversity-based (DIV), and a combination of both (CMB)) were used to classify text from five datasets. The performance of these algorithms was compared to that of passive learning on the five datasets. We then conducted a novel investigation of the interaction between dataset characteristics and the performance results. Measurements Classification accuracy and area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for each algorithm at different sample sizes were generated. The performance of active learning algorithms was compared with that of passive learning using a weighted mean of paired differences. To determine why the performance varies on different datasets, we measured the diversity and uncertainty of each dataset using relative entropy and correlated the results with the performance differences. Results The DIST and CMB algorithms performed better than passive learning. With a statistical significance level set at 0.05, DIST outperformed passive learning in all five datasets, while CMB was found to be better than passive learning in four datasets. We found strong correlations between the dataset diversity and the DIV performance, as well as the dataset uncertainty and the performance of the DIST algorithm. Conclusion For medical text classification, appropriate active learning algorithms can yield performance comparable to that of passive learning with considerably smaller training sets. In particular, our results suggest that DIV performs better on data with higher diversity and DIST on data with lower uncertainty.;accuracy- active learning- area under the curve- article- biomedicine- clinical classification- clinical text classification- controlled study- entropy- learning algorithm- passive learning- probability- randomization- sample size- task performance- algorithm- artificial intelligence- comparative study- data mining- human- methodology- natural language processing- receiver operating characteristic- Algorithms- Artificial Intelligence- Data Mining- Humans- Natural Language Processing- ROC Curve;English;Article

One of the primary achievements of this bar is to limit short-circuit currents to a maximum of 1.5 p.u. of the actual process current. However, low-current short circuits are more difficult to detect. Thus, conventional short-circuit detection instruments like gaussmeters and infrared cameras become ineffective. To overcome this problem, the proposed method is based on detecting the voltage drop across anode-cathode pairs. The method does not affect the operation of the process and does not require modifications of the industrial plant.

For fairness and completeness, efficiency is calculated for three major battleground scenarios. The first is a low dynamic nonregenerative group of applications such as pumps, fans, and compressors. This group represents 85% of high power (∼2 MW) industrial applications where energy savings are usually a primary consideration justifying investment. The second scenario considers applications requiring good dynamic response and regenerative braking. Finally, the third group considers very high power applications (over 20 MW). The evaluation presented takes into account semiconductor switching and conduction losses, losses in the medium voltage feeding transformer (determined per IEEE Standard C57.18.10-1998), and the losses in ac and dc filters. For purposes of analysis, computer simulations validated against measurements taken on a 1-MW voltage source inverter (VSI) and a 1.4-MW current source inverter (CSI) were used. The results of the first scenario show competitive efficiencies for VSI and CSI drives, whereas voltage source-based solutions are more energy efficient in the second scenario considered. For the last group, the current source load-commutated inverter exhibits the best performance. © 2008 IEEE.;Computer simulation- Electric converters- Electric machinery- Energy conservation- Power electronics- Semiconductor switches- Current source inverter- Multilevel systems- Voltage source inverter- AC motors;English;Article

Specifically, proposes a measurement technique for the cathodic currents in dog-bone type inter-cell bars using linear radiometric Hall effect sensors and ferromagnetic flux concentrators. The method is highly non-invasive and fully compatible with these processes - it does not require any modification to cell structures, and enables on-line monitoring of the cathode currents. This opens a window for full automation based on cathode weight and harvesting time estimation. It also enables process optimization and setting of the maximum process current Finally, adds the capability of detecting and locating metallurgical short-circuits upon early stages of genesis. The proposed measurement method was verified under different operational conditions using experimental data from a copper refinery facility. Results show an accuracy error lower than 4% even in the worst case of multiple adjacent short-circuits. © 2007 IEEE.;Annual meetings- Cathode currents- Cathodic currents- Cell structuring- Copper electrowinning (EW)- Copper refineries- Current distributions- Dog-bone type- Early stages- Electro-refining- Experimental data- Hall effect sensors- Measurement methods- Measurement techniques- Non invasive- On-line monitoring- Operational conditions- Paper addresses- Process current- Process optimization- Short-circuits (SC)- Time estimation- Worst case- Copper- Electric currents- Galvanomagnetic effects- Hall effect- Magnetic field effects- Optimization- Copper metallurgy;English;Conference Paper

One of the primary achievements of this bar is to limit short-circuit currents to a maximum of 1.5 pu of the actual process current However, low current short circuits are more difficult to detect. Thus, conventional short circuit detection instruments like gaussmeters and infrared cameras become ineffective. To overcome this problem the proposed method is based on detecting the voltage drop across anode-cathode pairs. The method does not affect the operation of the process and does not require modifications of the industrial plant. In order to verify the performance of this proposal experimental measurement done over a period of four months at a copper refinery are presented. A 100% success rate was obtained. © 2007 IEEE.;Copper- Copper metallurgy- Diffractive optical elements- Electric currents- Electric fault location- Industrial management- Industrial plants- Networks (circuits)- Switching circuits- Annual meetings- Anode-cathode (AK)- Copper electrowinning (EW)- Copper refineries- Electro-refining- Electrolytic processes- Experimental measurements- Infrared (IR) cameras- Intercell (CO)- Low current (Itc)- Process current- Short circuit (SC)- Short circuit current (SCC)- Short circuit detection- Short-circuits (SC)- Voltage drops- Short circuit currents;English;Conference Paper

Specifically, the aim of production-level increase, quality improvement, and costs reduction in electrowinning and electrorefining plants have been limited by the current-density (CD) dispersion. In fact, the cathodes of a plant designed to operate with a nominal 320 A/m2 CD per cathode, usually presents CDs in a range between 220 and 20 A/m2 (±31% variations). Industrial tests performed in a copper ER plant proved that the proposed connection halves dispersion. It has been estimated that a 15% earnings increase should be obtained with the increase of efficiency, quality, and production. © 2006 IEEE.;Cathodes- Cost effectiveness- Electric currents- Quality assurance- Current-density dispersion- Current-source conncetion- Electrorefinery- Electrowinning- Electrolytic cells;English;Article

Furthermore, the accessibility and customization of robotic rehabilitation devices is a key challenge. The purpose of this work was the design and construction of a prototype of passive rehabilitation for the upper limb, intended for the functional recovery of the wrist and hand on a patient with hypotonia and hemiplegia in his left limb, to be used at home. The developed device consists of a robotic system controlled through a Raspberry pi and implementation of two electric actuators, one to mobilize the flexion and extension of the wrist and another for the opening and closing of the hand. It also used a plate transmission system to execute the movements. 3D printing technology was used to produce most of the prototype parts, which were designed by computer. In addition, an interface was created to establish communication between the user and the device and to be able to choose modalities and time of the therapy, which was visualized by a 7-inch touch screen. After construction, the device was tested to verify its operation, obtaining as a result that it fulfilled the established objectives and executed the movements correctly within the stipulated time. Future work is expected to improve the structure and expand the device's exercise modalities and including miofeedback. © 2021 IEEE.;3D printers- Robotics- Touch screens- Customisation- Design and construction- Design and Development- Functional recovery- Motor rehabilitation- Patient's suffering- Rehabilitation devices- Robotic rehabilitation- Stroke- Upper limbs- Patient rehabilitation;Spanish;Conference Paper

Derivative approaches consider using Linear Combination of Derivatives (LCD) and Fractional Derivatives (FDPα). Four informed healthy subjects, aging 35.8 ±11.0 years old, agreed to perform Handgrip maneuvers. Signals are recorded continually- a Finapres NOVA device is used for fiAP, while a BIOPAC System is used for PPG and ECG. PPG is smoothed and segmented by heartbeat- recording sections interfered with spiky blocking noise, are eliminated. Finally, PPG is processed using LCD and FDPα and their results are enriched using Lasso technique. Twenty records per subject at rest and twenty at raised BP are analyzed. Results show PPG to fiAP fitting errors 5.38% ±0.91 at resting fiAP and 5.86% ±1.21 at raised fiAP, being always lower than 15%, suggesting that derivative approaches could be suitable for medical applications.

This study shows how different nature factors concur in the occurrence of adverse events with iatrogenic results, there are problems related to technological complexity, with the materials used, with quality control in manufacturing, with the software involved, with maintenance procedures and obviously with the way that devices are being operated by healthcare personnel, and in some cases by the same patient if he is connected to the device. It is important, to perform multilateral studies, to detect and avoid factors that generate adverse events. To avoid the risk, measures must be taken into account within a wide range of tasks such as improving product quality, providing an adequate user training and reporting any dangerous event via technological surveillance for information feedback to manufacturers, aimed at improving the production or correcting deficiencies of medical devices. Unfortunately, it is not only necessary to act in the technological and administrative level, it is also necessary to eradicate practices such as the lobby and low transparent policies, on technology acquisition or marketing of products that do not meet all the requirements and regulations that helps to increase the quality services and avoid risks to patients and users. © 2016, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;adverse device effect- adverse drug reaction- Article- device failure- duodenoscope- health care personnel- human- iatrogenic disease- ionizing radiation- linear accelerator- medical device- medical ethics- medical technology- quality control- radiation injury- software;English;Article

The present study evaluated a hydrodynamic system that uses ozonated water for disinfecting hAM and assessed possible morphological alterations using histological analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). hAM fragments were experimentally contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (103 CFU/mL) and submitted to disinfection processes for 5, 10 and 15 minutes (1.95, 3.9 and 5.85 mg/cm2 (O3), respectively). The results of the water microbiological analysis showed that no microbial growth was detected in all water samples. The hAM surface monitoring with swab method and the analysis of fragment inoculated directly into the culture media revealed that no microbial growth was detected after 10 and 15 minutes. The SEM and histological analysis of hAM revealed that morphological alterations in the epithelium began after 10 minutes 3.9 mg/cm2 (O3) of the disinfection process, and significant changes in the epithelial cells were observed after 15 minutes (5.85 mg/cm2 (O3)). These findings indicates that the structural integrity of hAM was maintained during the process and suggest that the technique is a promising system to disinfect this biological material. © 2022 International Ozone Association.;Bacteria- Biological materials- Disinfection- Hydrodynamics- Ozone- Amniotic membranes- Disinfection process- Histological analysis- Human amniotic membrane- Hydrodynamic systems- Membrane fragments- Microbial growth- Morphological alteration- Ozonated water- Regenerative medicine- Scanning electron microscopy;English;Article

Ozone is a powerful oxidant, it has the ability to inactivate microorganisms in general, and ultrasound is an acoustic system generated through a piezoelectric crystal that also presents microbicidal effects. In the present study, a comparative analysis was made of the damage caused to Streptococcus mutans in vitro by ultrasound and ozone, through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AF) analysis. In addition, flow cytometry was used to determine microbial viability and the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) after the application of different techniques. The data obtained by means of microscopic analysis reveal that both ozone and ultrasound produce morphological alterations in bacteria, which become rod-shaped organisms. In addition to this deformation, on the microbial surface it was possible to identify crater-like impressions. In contrast, the irregularity of protuberances on the surface of the microbial wall was only detected when ozone was employed. Regarding the formation of ROS, it was observed that that ozone induces a significant growth (p < .05) of these molecules, while ultrasound does not present this effect. Ozone and ultrasound present microbicidal effects, however, ozone is more efficient. © 2020 International Ozone Association.;Acoustic fields- Atomic force microscopy- Scanning electron microscopy- Ultrasonics- Comparative analysis- Microbial surfaces- Microbial viability- Microbicidal effect- Microscopic analysis- Morphological alteration- Piezoelectric crystals- Streptococcus mutans- Ozone;English;Article

The possibility of extending this approach is explored when basis of vector spaces is built Tailored to the Problem Specificity (TPS) and not from the convenience or effectiveness of mathematical calculations. Standardized mathematical transformations, such as Fourier or polynomial transforms, could be extended toward TPS methods, on a basis, which properly encodes specific knowledge about a problem. Transition between methods is illustrated by comparing what happens in conventional Fourier transform with what happened during the development of Jewett Transform, reported in previous articles. The proper use of computational intelligence tools to perform Jewett Transform allowed complexity algorithm optimization, which encourages the search for a general TPS methodology.

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) proposed a new cortical parcellation that has not been thoroughly tested in a clinical setting. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation of fMRI and DES mapping with HCP areas in a clinical setting, and to evaluate the performance of fMRI mapping in motor and language tasks in patients with glioma, using DES as the gold standard. METHODS Forty patients with supratentorial gliomas were examined using preoperative fMRI and underwent awake craniotomy with DES. Functional activation maps were visualized on a 3D representation of the cortex, classified according to HCP areas, and compared with surgical mapping. RESULTS Functional MRI was successful in identifying language and motor HCP areas in most cases, including novel areas such as 55b and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Functional MRI had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 71%, respectively, for motor function in HCP area 4. Sensitivity and specificity were different according to the area and fMRI protocol- i.e., semantic protocols performed better in Brodmann area (BA) 55b/peri-sylvian language areas with 100% sensitivity and 20% specificity, and word production protocols in BAs 44 and 45 with 70% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Some compensation patterns could be observed, such as motor activation of the postcentral gyrus in precentral gliomas. CONCLUSIONS HCP areas can be detected in clinical scenarios of glioma surgery. These areas appear relatively stable across patients, but compensation patterns seem to differ, allowing occasional resection of activating areas. Newly described areas such as 55b and SLF can act as critical areas in language networks. Surgical planning should account for these parcellations. © AANS 2022, except where prohibited by US copyright law;connectome- diagnostic imaging- electrostimulation- glioma- human- nerve cell network- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- Connectome- Electric Stimulation- Glioma- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Nerve Net;English;Article

Over the course of a lifetime, estrogen produces several beneficial effects in healthy neurological tissues as well as cardioprotective effects, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, clinical evidence on the efficacy of hormone treatment in menopausal women has failed to confirm the benefit reported in observational studies. Unambiguously, enhanced verbal memory is the most robust finding from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, what merits consideration for future studies aiming to determine estrogen neuroprotective efficacy. Estrogen related brain activity and functional connectivity remain, however, unexplored. In this context, the resting state paradigm may provide valuable information about reproductive aging and hormonal treatment effects, and their relationship with brain imaging of functional connectivity may be key to understand and anticipate estrogen cognitive protective effects. To go in-depth into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying rapid-to-long lasting protective effects of estrogen, we will provide a comprehensive review of cognitive tasks used in animal studies to evaluate the effect of hormone treatment on cognitive performance and discuss about the tasks best suited to the demonstration of clinically significant differences in cognitive performance to be applied in human studies. Eventually, we will focus on studies evaluating the DMN activity and responsiveness to pharmacological stimulation in humans.

Recently, various technological tools have emerged to assist patients with GDM to meet glycemic goals and facilitate constant glucose monitoring, making these tasks more straightforward and comfortable. Objective: To evaluate the impact of remote monitoring technologies in assisting patients with GDM to achieve glycemic goals, and know the respective advantages and disadvantages when it comes to reducing risk during pregnancy, both for the mother and her child. Methods: A total of 188 articles were obtained with the keywords “gestational diabetes mellitus,” “GDM,” “gestational diabetes,” added to the evaluation levels associated with “glucose level,” “glycemia,” “glycemic index,” “blood sugar,” and the technological proposal to evaluate with “glucometerm” “mobile application,” “mobile applications,” “technological tools,” “telemedicine,” “technovigilance,” “wearable” published during the period 2016–2021, excluding postpartum studies, from three scientific databases: PUBMED, Scopus and Web of Science. These were managed in the Mendeley platform and classified using the PRISMA method. Results: A total of 28 articles were selected after elimination according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main measurement was glycemia and 4 medical devices were found (glucometer: conventional, with an infrared port, with Bluetooth, Smart type and continuous glucose monitor), which together with digital technology allow specific functions through 2 identified digital platforms (mobile applications and online systems). In four articles, the postprandial glucose was lower in the Tele-GDM groups than in the control group. Benefits such as improved glycemic control, increased satisfaction and acceptability, maternal confidence, decreased gestational weight gain, knowledge of GDM, and other relevant aspects were observed. There were also positive comments regarding the optimization of the medical team’s time. Conclusion: The present review offers the opportunity to know about the respective advantages and disadvantages of remote monitoring technologies when it comes to reducing risk during pregnancy. GDM centered technology may help to evaluate outcomes and tailor personalized solutions to contribute to women’s health. More studies are needed to know the impact on a healthcare system.

The issue is not trivial and the question remains as to how the dose management is managed, specifically, in Chile. The objective of this work is to record and synthesize doses to patient undergoing CT examination in three institutions in the Valparaíso Region. A prospective descriptive study was carried out for 3 months, including examinations of the head, thorax and pelvis. DICOM files were collected to extract relevant variable values. Dose distributions are different between hospitals, as they have different equipment installed and different acquisition protocols. The median CTDI (Computed Tomography Dose Index) observed are in general within the international range, with a large proportion of exams exceeding these values. The most relevant variables in dose control were the number of series associated with each exam, and the tube current. This study shows that patient doses in these three institutions are consistent with what has been reported internationally, with some room for improvement still available. It remains to be confirmed whether these conclusions can be extended to other institutions and other regions of Chile. © 2022 Sociedad Chilena de Radiología.;adult- article- Chile- computer assisted tomography- controlled study- digital imaging and communications in medicine- female- human- ionizing radiation- male- pelvis- prospective study- radiation dose- radiation dose distribution- thorax- X ray;Spanish;Article

Machine learning methods have been features of several tools in the fields of obstetrics and childcare. This present review aims to summarize the machine learning techniques to predict perinatal complications. Objective: To identify the applicability and performance of machine learning methods used to identify pregnancy complications. Methods: A total of 98 articles were obtained with the keywords “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “artificial intelligence,” and accordingly as they related to perinatal complications (“complications in pregnancy,” “pregnancy complications”) from three scientific databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. These were managed on the Mendeley platform and classified using the PRISMA method. Results: A total of 31 articles were selected after elimination according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The features used to predict perinatal complications were primarily electronic medical records (48%), medical images (29%), and biological markers (19%), while 4% were based on other types of features, such as sensors and fetal heart rate. The main perinatal complications considered in the application of machine learning thus far are pre-eclampsia and prematurity. In the 31 studies, a total of sixteen complications were predicted. The main precision metric used is the AUC. The machine learning methods with the best results were the prediction of prematurity from medical images using the support vector machine technique, with an accuracy of 95.7%, and the prediction of neonatal mortality with the XGBoost technique, with 99.7% accuracy. Conclusion: It is important to continue promoting this area of research and promote solutions with multicenter clinical applicability through machine learning to reduce perinatal complications. This systematic review contributes significantly to the specialized literature on artificial intelligence and women’s health.

Current exploration techniques, such as electromyography, do not provide accurate spatial information. Objective: The objective of this work is to perform a systematic review of the literature to synthesize the contributions that can offer functional MRI techniques commonly used in neuroimaging, applied to skeletal muscle: Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD), IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE). Evidence acquisition: Web of Science and Medline databases were searched, over the last 10 years, focused on the use of BOLD, ASL, IVIM or DCE in skeletal muscle. Evidence synthesis: 59 articles were included after applying the selection criteria. 37 studies were performed in healthy subjects, and 22 in patients with different pathologies: in peripheral arterial disease, systemic sclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and dermatomyositis. Reference values in healthy subjects still vary in some cases. Conclusion: The studies show the feasibility of implementing functional MRI through BOLD, ASL, IVIM or DCE imaging in several muscles and their possible utility in different pathologies. A synthesis of how to implement such exploration is given here. Clinical impact: These four techniques are based on sequences already present in clinical MRI scanners, therefore, their use for functional muscle exploration does not require additional investment. These techniques allow visualization and quantification of parameters associated with the vascular health of the muscles and represent interesting support for musculoskeletal exploration. © 2021;adolescent idiopathic scoliosis- arterial spin labeling- blood oxygen level dependent imaging- BOLD signal- dermatomyositis- diabetes mellitus- diagnostic test accuracy study- dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging- functional magnetic resonance imaging- human- intermethod comparison- intravoxel incoherent motion imaging- neuroimaging- osteoporosis- peripheral occlusive artery disease- program feasibility- reference value- Review- skeletal muscle- systematic review- systemic sclerosis- adolescent- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- motion- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- skeletal muscle- contrast medium- spin label- Adolescent- Contrast Media- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Motion- Muscle, Skeletal- Spin Labels;English;Review

Most quality controls rely on routine tests using phantoms, which do not reflect closely the reality of images obtained on patients and do not reflect directly the quality perceived by radiologists. The purpose of this work is to develop a method that classifies the image quality perceived by radiologists in MR images. The focus was set on lumbar images as they are widely used with different challenges. Three neuroradiologists evaluated the image quality of a dataset that included T1-weighting images in axial and sagittal orientation, and sagittal T2-weighting. In parallel, we introduced the computational assessment using a wide range of features extracted from the images, then fed them into a classifier system. A total of 95 exams were used, from our local hospital and a public database, and part of the images was manipulated to broaden the distribution quality of the dataset. Good recall of 82% and an area under curve (AUC) of 77% were obtained on average in testing condition, using a Support Vector Machine. Even though the actual implementation still relies on user interaction to extract features, the results are promising with respect to a potential implementation for monitoring image quality online with the acquisition process. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: We compared the quality of three methods: Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP)- Compressed Sensing using Identity (CSI) and Compressed Sensing using Dictionary (CSD) with simulated data and in vivo acquisitions. We used retrospective undersampling so that the fully sampled reconstruction could be used as ground truth. We used the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient as reconstruction quality indices. Additionally, we evaluated two propagator-based diffusion indices: mean squared displacement and return to zero probability. We also did a visual analysis around the centrum semiovale. Results: All methods had reconstruction errors below 5% with low undersampling factors and with a wide range of noise levels. However, the CSD method had at least 1–2% lower NMSE than the other reconstruction methods at higher noise levels. MAP was the second-best method when using a sufficiently high number of q-space samples. MAP reconstruction showed better propagator-based diffusion indices for in vivo acquisitions. With undersampling factors greater than 4, MAP and CSI have noticeably more reconstruction error than CSD. Conclusion: Undersampled data were best reconstructed by means of CSD in simulations and in vivo. MAP was more accurate in the extraction of propagator-based indices, particularly for in vivo data. © 2019 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.;diffusion weighted imaging- human- image processing- procedures- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

The classic fMRI analysis pipeline is based on the assumption that the hemodynamic response (HR) is the same across brain regions, time, and subjects. Although convenient, there is ample evidence that this assumption does not hold, and that these differences result in inaccuracies in brain activity detection. This article presents a new fMRI processing pipeline that captures the intrinsic intra-and intersubject variability of the HR. At the core of this new pipeline is the definition of a fuzzy hemodynamic response function (HRF). The proposed pipeline includes a new fuzzy general linear model (GLM) able to handle the fuzzy HRF, including a practical realization based on the LR representation of fuzzy numbers. This article also describes how to obtain activation maps from the fuzzy GLM, and a methodology to compute the statistical power of the analysis. The method is evaluated in synthetic and real fMRI data and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments based on synthetic data show that the fuzzy GLM approach is more robust under uncertainty regarding the true specific shape of the HR. The experiments based on the real data show an increased volume of the activated brain areas, suggesting that the proposed method is able to prevent false negative errors in the boundaries of target brain regions in which HR should be negligible. © 1993-2012 IEEE.;Activation analysis- Brain- Fuzzy rules- Hemodynamics- Magnetic resonance imaging- Magnetism- Pipelines- Resonance- False negative errors- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- Fuzzy numbers- General linear modeling- Hemodynamic response- Hemodynamic response functions- Neuroimaging techniques- State-of-the-art techniques- Functional neuroimaging;English;Article

Nevertheless, there is no clear reference protocol for its implementation- one of the questions being which b-value distribution to use. This study aimed to stress the importance of the sampling scheme and to show that an optimized b-value distribution decreases the variance associated with IVIM parameters in the brain with respect to a regular distribution in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten volunteers were included in this study- images were acquired on a 1.5T MR scanner. Two distributions of 16 b-values were used: one considered ‘regular’ due to its close association with that used in other studies, and the other considered ‘optimized’ according to previous studies. IVIM parameters were adjusted according to the bi-exponential model, using two-step method. Analysis was undertaken in ROI defined using in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas, and parameters distributions were compared in a total of 832 ROI. Results: Maps with fewer speckles were obtained with the ‘optimized’ distribution. Coefficients of varia-tion did not change significantly for the estimation of the diffusion coefficient D but decreased by approx-imately 39% for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient estimation and by 21% for the perfusion fraction. Distributions of adjusted parameters were found significantly different in 50% of the cases for the perfusion fraction, in 80% of the cases for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient and 17% of the cases for the diffusion coefficient. Observations across brain areas show that the range of average values for IVIM parameters is smaller in the ‘optimized’ case. Conclusion: Using an optimized distribution, data are sampled in a way that the IVIM signal decay is better described and less variance is obtained in the fitted parameters. The increased precision gained could help to detect small variations in IVIM parameters. © 2019 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.;brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- human- image processing- movement (physiology)- physiology- procedures- Brain- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Movement;English;Article

These methods use as input the sampling obtained using square uniform patches centered on each voxel of the image, which could not be the optimal approach since there is a very limited use of global context. In this work we present a new construction method for the patches by means of a circular non-uniform sampling of the neighborhood of the voxels. This allows a greater global context with a radial extension with respect to the central voxel. This approach was applied on the 2015 Longitudinal MS Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset, obtaining better results than approaches using square uniform and non-uniform patches with the same computational cost of the CNN models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;Convolution- Magnetic resonance imaging- Neural networks- Pattern recognition- Computational costs- Convolutional neural network- Lesion segmentations- Multiple sclerosis lesions- New constructions- Non-uniform- Nonuniform sampling- Optimal approaches- Image segmentation;English;Conference Paper

In addition, the greater number of these models have a rigid architecture which prevents the incremental learning of new classes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the Self-Improving Generative Artificial Neural Network (SIGANN), an end-to-end deep neural network system which can ease the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning new classes. In this method, we introduce a novel detection model that automatically detects samples of new classes, and an adversarial autoencoder is used to produce samples of previous classes. This system consists of three main modules: a classifier module implemented using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, a generator module based on an adversarial autoencoder, and a novelty-detection module implemented using an OpenMax activation function. Using the EMNIST data set, the model was trained incrementally, starting with a small set of classes. The results of the simulation show that SIGANN can retain previous knowledge while incorporating gradual forgetfulness of each learning sequence at a rate of about 7% per training step. Moreover, SIGANN can detect new classes that are hidden in the data with a median accuracy of 43% and, therefore, proceed with incremental class learning. © 2019 by the authors.;Deep learning- Neural networks- Activation functions- Catastrophic forgetting problem- Convolutional neural network- Detection models- Incremental learning- Learning sequences- Neural network systems- Novelty detection- Deep neural networks;English;Article

Currently, several studies recognize that physical activity (PA) benefits brain health in children. However, most of these studies have not been carried out in developing countries or lack the transference into the education field. The Cogni-Action Project is divided into two stages, a cross-sectional study and a crossover-randomized trial. The aim of the first part is to establish the associations of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness with brain structure and function, cognitive performance and academic achievement in Chilean schoolchildren (10-13 years-old). The aim of the second part is to determinate the acute effects of three PA protocols on neuroelectric indices during a working memory and a reading task. Methods: PA and sedentarism will be self-reported and objectively-assessed with accelerometers in a representative subsample, whilst physical fitness will be evaluated through the ALPHA fitness test battery. Brain structure and function will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a randomized subsample. Cognitive performance will be assessed through the NeuroCognitive Performance Test, and academic achievement by school grades. In the second part 32 adolescents (12-13 year-old) will be cross-over randomized to these condition (i) ""Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training"" (MICT), (ii) ""Cooperative High-Intensity Interval Training"" (C-HIIT), and (iii) Sedentary condition. Neuroelectric indices will be measures by electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking, working memory by n-back task and reading comprehension by a reading task. Discussion: The main strength of this project is that, to our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the potential association of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness on brain structure and function, cognitive performance, and academic achievement in a developing country, which presents an important sociocultural gap. For this purpose, this project will use advanced technologies in neuroimaging (MRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and eye-tracking, as well as objective and quality measurements of several physical and cognitive health outcomes.

One of the simplest solutions to this issue is adding samples of previous data, with the drawback of increasingly having to store training data- or generating patterns that evoke similar responses of the previous task. We propose a model using a Recurrent Neural Network-based image generator in order to provide a Deep Convolutional Network a limited number of samples for new training data. Simulation results shows that our proposal is able to retain previous knowledge whenever some few pseudo-samples of previously recorded patterns are generated. Despite having lower performance than giving the network samples of the real dataset, this model is more biologically plausible and might help to reduce the need of storing previously trained data on bigger-scale classification classification models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;Classification (of information)- Convolution- Deep learning- Neural networks- Neurology- Recurrent neural networks- Catastrophic forgetting- Classification models- Computational neuroscience- Connectionist models- Convolutional networks- Convolutional neural network- Incremental learning- Stability-plasticity dilemma- Deep neural networks;English;Conference Paper

Both measurements have drawn interest in many applications, especially in skeletal muscle studies, which have short T2 values. Multiple echo single-shot schemes have been proposed to obtain those variables simultaneously within a single scan, resulting in a reduction of the scanning time. However, one problem with those approaches is the associated long echo read-out. Consequently, the minimum achievable echo time tends to be long, limiting the application of these sequences to tissues with relatively long T2. Materials and Methods To address this problem, we propose to extend the multi-echo sequences using a multi-shot approach, so that to allow shorter echo times. A multi-shot dual-echo EPI sequence with diffusion gradients and echo navigators was modified to include independent diffusion gradients in any of the two echoes. Results The multi-shot approach allows us to drastically reduce echo times. Results showed a good agreement for the T2 and mean diffusivity measurements with gold standard sequences in phantoms and in vivo data of calf muscles from healthy volunteers.

However, due to the large number of variables that can be obtained, overall analysis may represent a complex task. To facilitate this, we propose to create a model for classifying different hemodynamic variables between those belonging to a healthy individual and to a pathological patient. For this purpose, we employed data mining techniques to identify relationships among various aortic hemodynamic parameters obtained through multi-dimensional (4D flow) MR imaging. Method: A 4D flow sequence of whole heart and great vessels was acquired using MRI in 19 healthy volunteers and 2 patients (one with aortic coarctation and one with repaired coarctation of the aorta). Retrospectively, data were reformatted along the aorta- three MRI acquisitions were performed for volunteers and 30 sequences for each patient. In each slice the aorta was segmented and various parameters were quantified: area, maximum velocity, minimum velocity, flow and volumen, with following values being calculated for last four parameters: maximum, average, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, proportion of time to reach the maximum value, among others. A total of 26 variables for each acquisition were obtained. In order to classify data, the CART Technique (Classification and Regression Trees) was applied. To validate the model, two extra projections were generated per each volunteer and 20 slice per each patient. Results: By using only 7 variables, the CART Technique allows discrimination between images performed either on volunteers or patients with an error rate of 14.1%, a sensitivity of 82.5%, and a specificity of 89.4%. Conclusions: 4D flow MR imaging provides a wealth of hemodynamic data that can be difficult to analyze. In this paper we demonstrate that by using data mining techniques it is possible to classify images from relevant hemodynamic parameters and their relationships in order to support the diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders.;-;English- Spanish;Article

However, there is no precise anatomical description of some of the processes of human fetal development. The purpose of our study is to develop a quantitative description of the normal axial skeleton by means of high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) images, collected from six normal 20-week-old human fetuses fixed in formaldehyde. Methods: Fetuses were collected after spontaneous abortion and subsequently fixed with formalin. They were imaged using a 1.5T MR scanner with an isotropic spatial resolution of 200μm. The correct tissue discrimination between ossified and cartilaginous bones was confirmed by comparing the images achieved by MR scans and computerized axial tomographies. The vertebral column was segmented out from each image using a specially developed semi-automatic algorithm. Results: Vertebral body dimensions and inter-vertebral distances were larger in the lumbar region, in agreement with the beginning of the ossification process from the thoracolumbar region toward the sacral and cephalic ends. Conclusion: In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of using MR images to study the ossification process in formalin-fixed fetal tissues.

In these settings, different positions were taken as regards which subject to emphasize. In such a context, this work aimed to make a survey on the ""state-of-the-art"" of undergraduate BME education in LA, and to analyze the observed differences. Broadly speaking, similar education profiles are perceived in the entire continent, with main emphasis on electronics and bioinstrumentation, biology and informatics respectively.

It is commonly used in the assessment of stroke and in white matter fiber tracking, among other applications. The diffusion coefficient has been shown to depend on cell concentration, membrane permeability, and cell orientation in the case of white matter or muscle fiber tracking- yet a clear relation between diffusion measurements and known physiological parameters is not established. The aim of this paper is to review hypotheses and actual knowledge on diffusion signal origin to provide assistance in the interpretation of diffusion MR images. Focus will be set on brain images, as most common applications of diffusion MRI are found in neuroradiology. Diffusion signal does not come from two intra- or extracellular compartments, as was first assumed. Restriction of water displacement due to membranes, hindrance in the extracellular space, and tissue heterogeneity are important factors. Unanswered questions remain on how to deal with tissue heterogeneity, and how to retrieve parameters less troublesome to work with from biological and clinical points of view.

Aim: To evaluate the adherence to offi-cial guidelines with regard to the use of diagnostic methods for patients with acute ischemic stroke during their stay in a public hospital. Patients and Methods: The study included a review of the medical records of 101 patients aged 70 ±13 years (49 males and 52 females) diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke and discharged within August and September of 2008 and 2009 from a public hospital. Three trained observers independently determined the degree of dependency of patients at discharge using the Modified Rankin score. The completion of recommended diagnostic tests (electrocardiogram, carotid Doppler ultrasound and echocardiogram) as well as their overuse was evaluated. Results: Ten patients died before discharge, 38% were discharged with and 52% were discharged without disabilities. Nineteen percent of patients with a Modified Rankin score of two or less (corresponding to a slight disability) had a complete diagnostic workup, compared with 87% of patients with a score of 3 to 5 (moderate to severe disability). In 27% of the patients, there was an overuse of diagnostic tests. No association between the diagnostic test use adequacy and year of discharge was observed.

However, an evolutionary process of creating an efficient microfluidic array for many different bioassays is necessary. Specifically for a complete view of a cell response it is essential to incorporate cytotoxic, protein and gene analysis on a single system. Here we present a novel cellular and molecular analysis platform, which allows access to gene expression, protein immunoassay, and cytotoxicity information in parallel. It is realized by an integrated microfluidic array plate (iMAP). The iMAP enables sample processing of cells, perfusion based cell culture, effective perturbation of biologic molecules or drugs, and simultaneous, real-time optical analysis for different bioassays. The key features of the iMAP design are the interface of on-board gravity driven flow, the open access input fluid exchange and the highly efficient sedimentation based cell capture mechanism (∼100% capture rates). The operation of the device is straightforward (tube and pump free) and capable of handling dilute samples (5-cells per experiment), low reagent volumes (50 nL per reaction), and performing single cell protein and gene expression measurements. We believe that the unique low cell number and triple analysis capabilities of the iMAP platform can enable novel dynamic studies of scarce cells. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.;paclitaxel- article- bioassay- cell culture- cell proliferation- computational fluid dynamics- controlled study- cytotoxicity- female- gene expression- human- human cell- immunoassay- immunofluorescence test- integrated microfluidic array plate- lab on a chip- microarray analysis- perfusion- priority journal- protein immunoassay- sedimentation- single cell analysis;English;Article

SIMBAS only requires the user to place a 5 μL droplet of whole-blood at the inlet port of the device, whereupon the stand-alone SIMBAS performs on-chip removal of red and white cells, without external valving or pumping mechanisms, followed by analyte detection in platelet-containing plasma. Five complete biotin-streptavidin sample-to-answer assays are performed in 10 min- the limit of detection is 1.5 pM. Red and white blood cells are removed by trapping them in an integral trench structure. Simulations and experimental data show 99.9% to 100% blood cell retention in the passive structure. Powered by pre-evacuation of its PDMS substrate, SIMBAS' guiding design principle is the integration of the minimal number of components without sacrificing effectiveness in performing rapid complete bioassays, a critical step towards point-of-care molecular diagnostics. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.;biotin- streptavidin- article- bioassay- blood analysis- blood cell- blood sampling- cell assay- device- enzyme substrate- erythrocyte- extraction- flow rate- hospital information system- lab on a chip- leukocyte- microfluidic analysis- microtechnology- molecular diagnosis- priority journal- self powered integrated microfluidic blood analysis system- separation technique- simulation;English;Article

This method takes advantage of the inherently high porosity and air solubility of PDMS by removing air molecules from the bulk PDMS before initiating the flow. The dynamics of degas-driven flow are dependent on the channel and device geometries and are highly sensitive to temporal parameters. These dependencies have not been fully characterized, hindering broad use of degas-driven flow as a microfluidic pumping mechanism. Here, we characterize, for the first time, the effect of various parameters on the dynamics of degas-driven flow, including channel geometry, PDMS thickness, PDMS exposure area, vacuum degassing time, and idle time at atmospheric pressure before loading. We investigate the effect of these parameters on flow velocity as well as channel fill time for the degas-driven flow process. Using our devices, we achieved reproducible flow with a standard deviation of less than 8% for flow velocity, as well as maximum flow rates of up to 3 nL/s and mean flow rates of approximately 1-1.5 nL/s. Parameters such as channel surface area and PDMS chip exposure area were found to have negligible impact on degas-driven flow dynamics, whereas channel cross-sectional area, degas time, PDMS thickness, and idle time were found to have a larger impact. In addition, we develop a physical model that can predict mean flow velocities within 6% of experimental values and can be used as a tool for future design of PDMS-based microfluidic devices that utilize degas-driven flow. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.;Atmospheric pressure- Dynamics- Flow velocity- Fluidic devices- Microchannels- Microfluidics- Cross sectional area- Device geometries- Experimental values- Mean flow velocities- Micro-fluidic devices- Microfluidic pumping- Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS- Standard deviation- Atmospheric movements;English;Article

The hybrid integrated PDMS microfluidics and silica capillary (iPSC) modules exhibit a novel architecture and method for leakage free CE sample injection merely requiring a single high voltage source and one pair of electrodes. The use of the iPSC device is based on a modular approach which allows the capillary to be reused extensively whilst replacing the attached fluidic module for different experiments. Integrating fused silica capillaries with PDMS microfluidic modules allows the direct application of a wide variety of well established conventional CE protocols for separations of complex analytes. Furthermore it bears the potential for facile coupling to standard electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), letting users focus on the sample analysis rather than the development of new separation protocols. The fabrication of the iPSC module consists of a simple and quick three-step method that submerges a fused silica capillary in PDMS prepolymer. After cross linking the prepolymer and punching the inlets, the iPSC module layer can be mounted onto a microfluidic device for CE separation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010.;dimeticone- silicon dioxide- article- electrospray mass spectrometry- microfluidics- nonhuman- priority journal- Harness;English;Article

The aim of this study was to investigate the cutaneous mechanisms underlying such beneficial consequences of touch by determining whether daily stroking, specifically targeted to activate a velocity/force tuned class of low-threshold c-fiber mechanoreceptor (CLTM), confers resilience against established markers of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 2 weeks of CMS. Throughout the CMS protocol, some rats were stroked daily, either at CLTM optimal velocity (5 cm/s) or outside the CLTM optimal range (30 cm/s). A third CMS exposed group did not receive any tactile stimulation. The effect of CMS on serum corticosterone levels, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in these three groups was assessed in comparison to a control group of non-CMS exposed rats. While stroking did not mitigate the effects of CMS on body weight gain, CLTM optimal velocity stroking did significantly reduce CMS-induced elevations in corticosterone following an acute forced-swim. Rats receiving CLTM optimal stroking also showed significantly fewer anxiety-like behaviors (elevated plus-maze) than the other CMS exposed rats. In terms of depressive-like behavior, whereas the same velocity-specific resilience was observed in a forced-swim test and social interaction test both groups of stroked rats spent significantly less time interacting than control rats, though they also spent significantly less time in the corner than non-stroked CMS rats. Together, these findings support the theory CLTMs play a functional role in regulating the physiological condition of the body. © 2020 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;corticosterone- animal- anxiety- male- mammal- mental stress- physiology- rat- Sprague Dawley rat- touch- Animals- Anxiety- Corticosterone- Male- Mammals- Rats- Rats, Sprague-Dawley- Stress, Psychological- Touch- Touch Perception;English;Article

Network dynamics such as transition patterns and the time the brain stays in each network link to cognition and behavior and are subject to much investigation. Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), the temporally fluctuating unprovoked experience of hearing voices, are associated with aberrant resting state network activity. However, we lack a clear understanding of how different networks contribute to aberrant activity over time. An accurate characterization of latent network dynamics and their relation to neurocognitive changes necessitates methods that capture the sub-second temporal fluctuations of the networks’ functional connectivity signatures. Here, we critically evaluate the assumptions and sensitivity of several approaches commonly used to assess temporal dynamics of brain connectivity states in M/EEG and fMRI research, highlighting methodological constraints and their clinical relevance to AVH. Identifying altered brain connectivity states linked to AVH can facilitate the detection of predictive disease markers and ultimately be valuable for generating individual risk profiles, differential diagnosis, targeted intervention, and treatment strategies. © 2022;auditory hallucination- auditory verbal hallucination- bipolar disorder- depression- dynamics- electroencephalogram- functional connectivity- functional magnetic resonance imaging- hidden Markov model- human- Parkinson disease- resting state network- Review- schizophrenia- brain- brain mapping- diagnostic imaging- hallucination- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- schizophrenia- Brain- Brain Mapping- Hallucinations- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Schizophrenia;English;Review

Here, we investigate how the intrinsic propensity of different regions to get ignited is determined by the specific topological organisation of the structural connectome. More specifically, we simulated the resting-state dynamics of mean-field whole-brain models and assessed how dynamic multi-stability and ignition differ between a reference model embedding a realistic human connectome, and alternative models based on a variety of randomised connectome ensembles. We found that the strength of global excitation needed to first trigger ignition in a subset of regions is substantially smaller for the model embedding the empirical human connectome. Furthermore, when increasing the strength of excitation, the propagation of ignition outside of this initial core-which is able to self-sustain its high activity-is way more gradual than for any of the randomised connectomes, allowing for graded control of the number of ignited regions. We explain both these assets in terms of the exceptional weighted core-shell organisation of the empirical connectome, speculating that this topology of human structural connectivity may be attuned to support enhanced ignition dynamics. © 2020 Castro et al.";article- brain- connectome- controlled study- embedding- excitation- human- randomized controlled trial- simulation- algorithm- anatomy and histology- biology- brain cortex- connectome- diagnostic imaging- male- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- physiology- procedures- Algorithms- Cerebral Cortex- Computational Biology- Connectome- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male;English;Article

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition with canonical correlation analysis (EEMD-CCA) has been proven to be an efficient method for denoising of EEG contaminated with muscle artifacts. EEMD-CCA, likewise the majority of algorithms, does not incorporate any statistical information of the artifact, namely, electromyogram (EMG) recorded over the muscles actively contaminating the EEG. In this paper, we propose to extend EEMD-CCA in order to include an EMG array as information to aid the removal of artifacts, assessing the performance gain achieved when the number of EMG channels grow. By filtering adaptively (recursive least squares, EMG array as reference) each component resulting from CCA, we aim to ameliorate the distortion of brain signals induced by artifacts and denoising methods. We simulated several noise scenarios based on a linear contamination model, between real and synthetic EEG and EMG signals, and varied the number of EMG channels available to the filter. Our results exhibit a substantial improvement in the performance as the number of EMG electrodes increase from 2 to 16. Further increasing the number of EMG channels up to 128 did not have a significant impact on the performance. We conclude by recommending the use of EMG electrodes to filter components, as it is a computationally inexpensive enhancement that impacts significantly on performance using only a few electrodes. © 1963-2012 IEEE.;Adaptive filtering- Adaptive filters- Blind source separation- Electrodes- Electroencephalography- Least squares approximations- Muscle- Artifact removal- Canonical correlation analysis- Contamination modeling- Electro-encephalogram (EEG)- Electromyogram- Ensemble empirical mode decomposition- Recursive least square (RLS)- Statistical information- Biomedical signal processing;English;Article

The aim of this study was to use an experimental placebo conditioning paradigm to test whether expectancy for pain relief impacts on acute pain perception in individuals with a chronic pain diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) or fibromyalgia (FM), compared to healthy individuals (HIs). An inert cream was applied to the dominant forearm of participants (60 OA, 79 FM, and 98 HI), randomly assigned to either a placebo or control group. In both groups, an inactive cream was applied to the dominant forearm. The placebo group was told this may or may not be a local anaesthetic cream, whereas the control group was told the cream was inactive. Laser pain was delivered, and numerical pain intensity ratings collected before, during, and after cream application, along with expectation of pain relief and anxiety. The procedure was repeated 2 weeks later to assess reproducibility. There was a significant reduction in pain in the placebo group, independent of clinical diagnosis. Diagnostic groups (OA, FM, and HI) did not differ in their magnitude of placebo analgesia or expectancy of pain relief. The results were similar in the repeat session. The results demonstrate that individuals with chronic pain respond to experimental placebo analgesia in a similar and reproducible manner as HIs, despite higher levels of psychological comorbidity. This has implications for using placebo analgesia in the treatment of chronic pain.;analgesia- chronic pain- human- pain measurement- placebo effect- reproducibility- Analgesia- Chronic Pain- Humans- Pain Management- Pain Measurement- Placebo Effect- Reproducibility of Results;English;Article

Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants’ individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity. © Copyright © 2020 Otero, Prado-Gutiérrez, Weinstein, Escobar and El-Deredy.;adult- alpha rhythm- article- clinical article- controlled study- female- human- human experiment- male- oscillation- prediction- steady state- visual evoked potential- visual stimulation;English;Article

This synchronization defines the generation of steady-state evoked responses (i.e., oscillations in the electroencephalogram phase-locked to the driving stimuli). The classic interpretation of the amplitude of the steady-state evoked responses assumes a stereotypical time-invariant neural response plus random background fluctuations, such that averaging over repeated presentations of the stimulus recovers the stereotypical response. This approach ignores the dynamics of the steady-state, as in the case of the adaptation elicited by prolonged exposures to the stimulus. To analyze the dynamics of steady-state responses, it can be assumed that the time evolution of the response amplitude is the same in different stimulation runs separated by sufficiently long breaks. Based on this assumption, a method to characterize the time evolution of steady-state responses is presented. A sufficiently large number of recordings are acquired in response to the same experimental condition. Experimental runs (recordings) are column-wise averaged (i.e., runs are averaged but epoch within recordings are not averaged with the preceding segments). The column-wise averaging allows analysis of steady-state responses in recordings with remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore, the averaged signal provides an accurate representation of the time evolution of the steady-state response, which can be analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. In this study, a detailed description of the method is provided, using steady-state visually evoked potentials as an example of a response. Advantages and caveats are evaluated based on a comparison with single-trial methods designed to analyze neural entrainment.;electroencephalography- evoked response- human- physiology- procedures- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Humans;English;Article

One example is placebo analgesia, where expecting low pain causes a painful stimulus to feel less painful. Yet, because pain evolved to signal threats to survival, it should be maladaptive for highly-erroneous expectations to yield unrealistic pain experiences. Therefore, we hypothesised that a cue followed by a highly discrepant stimulus intensity, which generates a large prediction error, will have a weaker influence on the perception of that stimulus. To test this hypothesis we collected two independent pain-cueing datasets. The second dataset and the analysis plan were preregistered (https://osf.io/5r6z7/). Regression modelling revealed that reported pain intensities were best explained by a quartic polynomial model of the prediction error. The results indicated that the influence of cues on perceived pain decreased when stimulus intensity was very different from expectations, suggesting that prediction error size has an immediate functional role in pain perception. © 2019, The Author(s).;article- expectation- human- nociception- prediction- stimulus- adolescent- adult- association- factual database- female- male- nociception- photostimulation- physiology- statistical model- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Cues- Databases, Factual- Female- Humans- Male- Models, Statistical- Pain Perception- Photic Stimulation- Young Adult;English;Article

A child’s needs are usually conveyed by signals of distress revealed by crying faces. We tested whether infant and adult crying faces are processed differently in two sociodemographically similar groups of Neglectful (NM) and non-neglectful Control Mothers (CM). We used functional brain imaging to analyze the BOLD response from 43 mothers (23 neglectful and 20 control) while viewing faces from infants and adults (crying and neutral). In NM as compared to CM, the BOLD responses to both infant and adult crying faces were significantly reduced in the cerebellum, lingual, fusiform, amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus. The reduced BOLD was also modulated by comorbid psychiatric symptoms. In the CM, frontal activation to infant versus adult crying faces was enhanced, whereas in the NM activation in the anterior cingulate cortex to infant crying was reduced compared to adult crying. The altered neural response to crying faces in NM, showing generic face and infant-specific face processing deficits, could underlie their characteristic poor social abilities as well as their poor response to infant needs, both affecting the caregiving role. © 2019, The Author(s).;adult- crying- face- female- human- infant- limbic system- male- mother- photostimulation- physiology- preschool child- risk factor- vision- Adult- Child, Preschool- Crying- Face- Female- Humans- Infant- Limbic System- Male- Mothers- Photic Stimulation- Risk Factors- Visual Perception;English;Article

However little is known about the cognitive processes that underpin pain expectations, or what drives the differing effect that pain expectations have between individuals. This paper details the testing of a model of pain perception which formalises the response to pain in terms of a Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating process. Using data acquired from a short and deception-free predictive cue task, it was found that this Bayesian model predicted ratings of pain better than other, simpler models. At the group level, the results confirmed two core predictions of predictive coding- that expectation alters perception, and that increased uncertainty in the expectation reduces its impact on perception. The addition of parameters relating to trait differences in pain expectation improved the fit of the model, suggesting that such traits play a significant role in perception above and beyond the influence of expectations triggered by predictive cues. When the model parameters were allowed to vary by participant, the model's fit improved further. This final model produced a characterisation of each individual's sensitivity to pain expectations. This model is relevant for the understanding of the cognitive basis of pain expectations and could potentially act as a useful tool for guiding patient stratification and clinical experimentation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;adult- animal experiment- animal model- article- controlled study- deception- expectation- female- male- nociception- nonhuman- placebo effect- prediction- stratification- uncertainty;English;Article

However, to directly test the role of such oscillatory activity in behaviour, it is necessary to manipulate it. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) offers a method of directly manipulating oscillatory brain activity using a sinusoidal current passed to the scalp. We tested whether alpha tACS would change somatosensory sensitivity or response bias in a signal detection task in order to test whether alpha oscillations have a causal role in behaviour. Active 10 Hz tACS or sham stimulation was applied using electrodes placed bilaterally at positions CP3 and CP4 of the 10–20 electrode placement system. Participants performed the Somatic Signal Detection Task (SSDT), in which they must detect brief somatosensory targets delivered at their detection threshold. These targets are sometimes accompanied by a light flash, which could also occur alone. Active tACS did not modulate sensitivity to targets but did modulate response criterion. Specifically, we found that active stimulation generally increased touch reporting rates, but particularly increased responding on light trials. Stimulation did not interact with the presence of touch, and thus increased both hits and false alarms. TACS stimulation increased reports of touch in a manner consistent with our observational reports, changing response bias, and consistent with a role for alpha activity in somatosensory detection. © 2018;adult- alpha rhythm- Article- clinical article- controlled study- female- human- male- oscillation- signal detection- task performance- transcranial alternating current stimulation- young adult- physiology- procedures- psychomotor performance- touch- transcranial direct current stimulation- Alpha Rhythm- Female- Humans- Male- Psychomotor Performance- Touch Perception- Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation- Young Adult;English;Article

Event-related potential (ERP) studies of the influence of expectation on pain typically utilise laser heat stimulation to provide a controllable nociceptive-specific stimulus. Painful electric stimulation has a number of practical advantages, but is less nociceptive-specific. We compared the modulation of electric versus laser-evoked pain by expectation, and their corresponding pain-evoked and anticipatory ERPs. New method We developed understanding of recognised methods of laser and electric stimulation. We tested whether pain perception and neural activity induced by electric stimulation was modulated by expectation, whether this expectation elicited anticipatory neural correlates, and how these measures compared to those associated with laser stimulation by eliciting cue-evoked expectations of high and low pain in a within-participant design. Results Despite sensory and affective differences between laser and electric pain, intensity ratings and pain-evoked potentials were modulated equivalently by expectation, though ERPs only correlated with pain ratings in the laser pain condition. Anticipatory correlates differentiated pain intensity expectation to laser but not electric pain. Comparison with existing method Previous studies show that laser-evoked potentials are modulated by expectation. We extend this by showing electric pain-evoked potentials are equally modulated by expectation, within the same participants. We also show a difference between the pain types in anticipation. Conclusions Though laser-evoked potentials express a stronger relationship with pain perception, both laser and electric stimulation may be used to study the modulation of pain-evoked potentials by expectation. Anticipatory-evoked potentials are elicited by both pain types, but they may reflect different processes. © 2017;adult- Article- association- clinical article- electrostimulation- evoked response- female- human- laser- laser evoked potential- male- nociception- pain- pain evoked potential- pain intensity- priority journal- adolescent- anticipation- brain- comparative study- electroencephalography- pain- pain measurement- pathophysiology- perceptive discrimination- physiology- psychology- statistical model- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Anticipation, Psychological- Brain- Discrimination (Psychology)- Electric Stimulation- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Female- Humans- Lasers- Linear Models- Male- Pain- Pain Measurement- Pain Perception- Young Adult;English;Article

This is because when generating random sequences humans tend to systematically under- and overrepresent certain subsequences relative to the number expected from an unbiased random process. In a purely theoretical analysis we have previously suggested that common misperceptions of randomness may actually reflect genuine aspects of the statistical environment, once cognitive constraints are taken into account which impact on how that environment is actually experienced (Hahn & Warren, Psychological Review, 2009). In the present study we undertake an empirical test of this account, comparing human-generated against unbiased processgenerated binary sequences in two experiments. We suggest that comparing human and theoretically unbiased sequences using metrics reflecting the constraints imposed on human experience provides a more meaningful picture of lay people's ability to perceive randomness. Finally, we propose a simple generative model of human random sequence generation inspired by the Hahn and Warren account. Taken together our results question the notion of bias in human randomness perception. © 2017 American Psychological Association.;adult- human- Markov chain- pattern recognition- perception- physiology- probability- young adult- Adult- Humans- Pattern Recognition, Visual- Perception- Probability- Stochastic Processes- Young Adult;English;Article

Recent evidence challenged this interpretation and has led to the suggestion that this ERP expresses salience instead. Here, we distinguish between utility prediction error and salience by delivering or withholding hedonistically matched appetitive and aversive tastes, and measure ERPs to cues signaling each taste. We observed a typical FRN (computed as the loss-minus-gain difference wave) to appetitive taste, but a reverse FRN to aversive taste. When tested axiomatically, frontocentral ERPs showed a salience response across tastes, with a particularly early response to outcome delivery, supporting recent propositions of a fast, unsigned, and unspecific response to salient stimuli. ERPs also expressed aversive prediction error peaking at 285 ms, which conformed to the logic of an axiomatic model of prediction error. With stimuli that most resemble those used in animal models, we did not detect any frontocentral ERP signal for utility prediction error, in contrast with dominant views of the functional role of the FRN ERP. We link the animal and human literature and present a challenge for current perspectives on associative learning research using ERPs. © 2017 Society for Psychophysiological Research;adolescent- adult- affect- brain- brain mapping- electroencephalography- evoked response- female- human- male- physiology- reward- taste- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Affect- Brain- Brain Mapping- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Female- Humans- Male- Reward- Taste- Young Adult;English;Article

Electrophysiological studies suggest that impaired early visual processing may contribute to impaired WM in the visual domain. Abnormal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function has been implicated both in WM and in early visual processing deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated whether ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, would replicate in healthy volunteers the WM performance and early visual processing abnormalities we and others have reported in patients with schizophrenia. Methods Forty-four healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine or placebo. During infusion, the effects of ketamine were recorded using standardized psychiatric scales. Visual evoked potentials (P100 and P300 components) were recorded during performance of a delayed matching to sample task. Results Ketamine induced mild psychosis-like symptoms and impaired WM performance. It also significantly increased the P100 amplitude, while P300 amplitude decreased in a load-dependent manner. Amplitudes of P100 during retrieval correlated with cognitive performance only in the placebo group. Conclusions We confirmed previous studies showing that ketamine reproduces the impairment of WM performance and smaller P300 amplitudes observed in schizophrenia. However, ketamine increased visual P100 amplitude in contrast to our observation of reduced P100 amplitudes in established schizophrenia. The effects of ketamine on WM and P300 are likely to involve impaired NMDA function, as these receptors are implicated in changes of synaptic strength underlying associative learning and memory. Increased P100 amplitude may reflect the secondary disinhibition of cortical glutamate release that occurs after NMDA blockade. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry;glutamic acid- ketamine- n methyl dextro aspartic acid- n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor- placebo- amino acid receptor blocking agent- ketamine- adult- amplitude modulation- Article- Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale- Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale- cognition- controlled study- double blind procedure- drug effect- electroencephalogram- event related potential- human- human experiment- neurotransmitter release- normal human- priority journal- psychosis- randomized controlled trial- rating scale- schizophrenia- state dependent learning- synapse- task performance- visual evoked potential- visual memory- working memory- complication- evoked response- female- male- memory disorder- middle aged- neuropsychological test- short term memory- Adult- Cognition- Evoked Potentials- Evoked Potentials, Visual- Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists- Female- Humans- Ketamine- Male- Memory Disorders- Memory, Short-Term- Middle Aged- Neuropsychological Tests;English;Article

Its consequence on the structure and function of cortical networks is unknown. We tested whether cortical “resonance,” favorable stimulation frequencies at which the sensory cortices respond maximally, influenced the impact of FDP on perception, functional topography, and connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex using psychophysics and functional imaging (fMRI). We costimulated two digits on the hand synchronously at, above, or below the resonance frequency of the somatosensory cortex, and tested subjects’ accuracy and speed on tactile localization before and after costimulation. More errors and slower response times followed costimulation at above- or below-resonance, respectively. Response times were faster after at-resonance costimulation. In the fMRI, the cortical representations of the two digits costimulated above-resonance shifted closer, potentially accounting for the poorer performance. Costimulation at-resonance did not shift the digit regions, but increased the functional coupling between them, potentially accounting for the improved response time. To relate these results to synaptic plasticity, we simulated a network of oscillators incorporating Hebbian learning. Two neighboring patches embedded in a cortical sheet, mimicking the two digit regions, were costimulated at different frequencies. Network activation outside the stimulated patches was greatest at above-resonance frequencies, reproducing the spread of digit representations seen with fMRI. Connection strengths within the patches increased following at-resonance costimulation, reproducing the increased fMRI connectivity. We show that FDP extends to the cortical level and is influenced by cortical resonance. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

However, some reports of touch occur even without a stimulus. We investigated the possibility that pre-stimulus alpha oscillations might also influence these false reports of touch – known as tactile misperceptions. We recorded EEG while participants performed the Somatic Signal Detection Task (SSDT), in which participants must detect brief, peri-threshold somatosensory targets. We found that pre-stimulus oscillatory power in the somatosensory alpha range exhibited a negative linear relationship with reporting of touch at electrode clusters over both contralateral and ipsilateral somatosensory regions. As pre-stimulus alpha power increased, the probability of reporting a touch declined- as it decreased, the probability of reporting a touch increased. This relationship was stronger on trials without a somatosensory stimulus than on trials with a somatosensory stimulus, although was present for both trial types. Spatio-temporal cluster-based permutation analysis also found that pre-stimulus alpha was lower on trials when touch was reported – irrespective of whether it was present – over contralateral and ipsilateral somatosensory cortices, as well as left frontocentral areas. We argue that alpha power may reflect changes in response criterion rather than sensitivity alone. Low alpha power relates to a low barrier to reporting a touch even when one is not present, while high alpha power is linked to less frequent reporting of touch overall. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;adult- alpha rhythm- Article- controlled study- correlational study- electrode- electroencephalogram- female- human- human experiment- male- oscillatory potential- parietal cortex- perceptive discrimination- primary somatosensory cortex- Somatic Signal Detection Task- stimulus response- tactile misperception- temporal lobe- touch- adolescent- alpha rhythm- analysis of variance- brain mapping- electroencephalography- middle aged- physical stimulation- physiology- somatosensory cortex- time factor- touch- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Alpha Rhythm- Analysis of Variance- Brain Mapping- Electroencephalography- Female- Humans- Male- Middle Aged- Physical Stimulation- Signal Detection, Psychological- Somatosensory Cortex- Time Factors- Touch- Touch Perception- Young Adult;English;Article

For over 30 years, this simple demonstration of context dependence has been taken as strong evidence against a class of parsimonious value-maximising models that evaluate alternatives independently from one another. Significantly, however, in previous demonstrations of the attraction effect alternatives are approximately equally valuable, so there was little consequence to the decision maker irrespective of which alternative was selected. Here we vary the difference in expected value between alternatives and provide the first demonstration that, although extinguished with large differences, this theoretically important effect persists when choice between alternatives has a consequence. We use this result to clarify the implications of the attraction effect, arguing that although it robustly violates the assumptions of value-maximising models, it does not eliminate the possibility that human decision making is optimal. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. © 2016 The Authors Journal of Behavioral Decision Making Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;decision making- human- model;English;Article

However, the roles of early attentional and later cognitive processes remain unclear, limiting theoretical understanding and development of targeted interventions. Methods Twenty euthymic bipolar disorder and 19 matched control participants played a Roulette task in which they won and lost money. Event-related potentials and source analysis were used to quantify predominantly sensory-Attentional (N1), motivational salience (feedback-related negativities [FRN]), and cognitive appraisal (P300) stages of processing. We predicted that the bipolar disorder group would show increased N1, consistent with increased attentional orienting, and reduced FRN, consistent with a bias to perceive outcomes more favorably. Results As predicted, the bipolar disorder group showed increased N1 and reduced FRN but no differences in P300. N1 amplitude was additionally associated with real-life risk taking, and N1 source activity was reduced in visual cortex but increased activity in precuneus, frontopolar, and premotor cortex, compared to those of controls. Conclusions These findings demonstrate an early attentional bias to reward that potentially drives risk taking by priming approach behavior and elevating reward salience in the frontostriatal pathway. Although later cognitive appraisals of these inputs may be relatively intact in remission, interventions targeting attention orienting may also be effective in long-term reduction of relapse. © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.;anterior cingulate- Article- attentional bias- bipolar depression- bipolar mania- clinical article- controlled study- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex- electroencephalogram- event related potential- functional magnetic resonance imaging- high risk behavior- human- medial frontal cortex- precuneus- prefrontal cortex- premotor cortex- priority journal- remission- reward- ventral striatum- ventromedial prefrontal cortex- visual cortex- attention- bipolar disorder- brain- cognition- decision making- electroencephalography- evoked response- motivation- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- pathology- pathophysiology- Attention- Bipolar Disorder- Brain- Cognition- Decision Making- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Motivation- Reward- Risk-Taking;English;Article

At the microscopic scale, single neurons possess intrinsic oscillatory properties, such that is not yet known whether cortical resonance is consequential to neural oscillations or an emergent property of the networks that interconnect them. Using a network model of loosely-coupled Wilson-Cowan oscillators to simulate a patch of cortical sheet, we demonstrate that the size of the activated network is inversely related to its resonance frequency. Further analysis of the parameter space indicated that the number of excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as the average transmission delay between units, determined the resonance frequency. The model predicted that if an activated network within the visual cortex increased in size, the resonance frequency of the network would decrease. We tested this prediction experimentally using the steady-state visual evoked potential where we stimulated the visual cortex with different size stimuli at a range of driving frequencies. We demonstrate that the frequency corresponding to peak steady-state response inversely correlated with the size of the network. We conclude that although individual neurons possess resonance properties, oscillatory activity at the macroscopic level is strongly influenced by network interactions, and that the steady-state response can be used to investigate functional networks. © 2016 Lea-Carnall et al.;adult- Article- brain region- connectome- empirical research- evoked visual response- female- human- human experiment- male- mathematical analysis- nerve cell- nerve cell network- normal human- oscillation- steady state- visual cortex- visual stimulation- biological model- biology- computer simulation- nerve cell network- physiology- visual cortex- visual evoked potential- Computational Biology- Computer Simulation- Evoked Potentials, Visual- Humans- Models, Neurological- Nerve Net- Visual Cortex;English;Article

This is demonstrated by improved performance and neural plasticity underlying that improvement after sleep. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) allows the manipulation of sleep-dependent consolidation through intentionally biasing the replay of specific memories in sleep, but the underlying neural basis of these altered memories remains unclear. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show a change in the neural representation of a motor memory after targeted reactivation in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Participants learned two serial reaction time task (SRTT) sequences associated with different auditory tones (high or low pitch). During subsequent SWS, one sequence was reactivated by replaying the associated tones. Participants were retested on both sequences the following day during fMRI. As predicted, they showed faster reaction times for the cued sequence after targeted memory reactivation. Furthermore, increased activity in bilateral caudate nucleus and hippocampus for the cued relative to uncued sequence was associated with time in SWS, while increased cerebellar and cortical motor activity was related to time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Functional connectivity between the caudate nucleus and hippocampus was also increased after targeted memory reactivation. These findings suggest that the offline performance gains associated with memory reactivation are supported by altered functional activity in key cognitive and motor networks, and that this consolidation is differentially mediated by both REM sleep and SWS. © 2016 Cousins et al.;caudate nucleus- cerebellum- functional magnetic resonance imaging- hippocampus- human- human experiment- learning- memory- motor activity- pitch- reaction time- REM sleep- slow wave sleep- adolescent- adult- brain- electroencephalography- female- learning- male- non-therapeutic research- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- physiology- polysomnography- REM sleep- sleep- Adolescent- Adult- Brain- Electroencephalography- Female- Humans- Learning- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male- Nontherapeutic Human Experimentation- Polysomnography- Reaction Time- Sleep- Sleep, REM;English;Article

Current theoretical models propose that visual and auditory emotion perception involves a network of brain regions including the primary sensory cortices, the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, relatively little is known about how the dynamic interplay between these regions gives rise to the perception of emotions. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of neural oscillations in mediating neural communication within and between functional neural networks. Here we review studies investigating changes in oscillatory activity during the perception of visual, auditory, and audiovisual emotional expressions, and aim to characterize the functional role of neural oscillations in nonverbal emotion perception. Findings from the reviewed literature suggest that theta band oscillations most consistently differentiate between emotional and neutral expressions. While early theta synchronization appears to reflect the initial encoding of emotionally salient sensory information, later fronto-central theta synchronization may reflect the further integration of sensory information with internal representations. Additionally, gamma synchronization reflects facilitated sensory binding of emotional expressions within regions such as the OFC, STS, and, potentially, the amygdala. However, the evidence is more ambiguous when it comes to the role of oscillations within the alpha and beta frequencies, which vary as a function of modality (or modalities), presence or absence of predictive information, and attentional or task demands. Thus, the synchronization of neural oscillations within specific frequency bands mediates the rapid detection, integration, and evaluation of emotional expressions. Moreover, the functional coupling of oscillatory activity across multiples frequency bands supports a predictive coding model of multisensory emotion perception in which emotional facial and body expressions facilitate the processing of emotional vocalizations. © 2016 Symons, El-Deredy, Schwartze and Kotz.;amygdala- chemical binding- facial expression- human- human experiment- model- orbital cortex- oscillation- perception- prediction- recognition- superior temporal sulcus- vocalization;English;Review

This study investigated the effects of retention interval on recognition memory by comparing memory for objects encoded four weeks (remote) or 5 min (recent) before testing. In Experiment 1, event related potentials (ERPs) were acquired while participants performed a yes-no recognition memory task involving remote, recent and novel objects. Relative to correctly rejected new items, remote and recent hits showed an attenuated frontal negativity from 300–500 ms post-stimulus. This effect, also known as the FN400, has been previously associated with familiarity memory. Recent and remote recognition ERPs did not differ from each other at this time-window. By contrast, recent but not remote recognition showed increased parietal positivity from around 500 ms post-stimulus. This late parietal effect (LPE), which is considered a correlate of recollection-related processes, also discriminated between recent and remote memories. A second, behavioral experiment confirmed that remote memories unlike recent memories were based almost exclusively on familiarity. These findings support the idea that the FN400 and LPE are indices of familiarity and recollection memory, respectively and show that remote and recent memories are functionally and anatomically distinct. © 2015 Tsivilis, Allan, Roberts, Williams, Downes and El-Deredy.;adult- Article- brain region- controlled study- episodic memory- event related potential- female- frontal cortex- hemisphere- human- human experiment- male- memory consolidation- nerve cell- normal human- parietal cortex- reaction time- recognition- stimulus response- task performance- young adult;English;Article

Animal models of chronic pain point to upregulation of opioid receptors (OpR) in the brain, with unknown functional significance. We sought evidence for a similar relationship between chronic pain and OpR availability in humans. Using positron emission tomography and the radiotracer 11C-diprenorphine, patients with arthritis pain (n=17) and healthy controls (n=9) underwent whole-brain positron emission tomography scanning to calculate parametric maps of OpR availability. Consistent with the upregulation hypothesis, within the arthritis group, greater OpR availability was found in the striatum (including the caudate) of patients reporting higher levels of recent chronic pain, as well as regions of interest in the descending opioidergic pathway including the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray. The functional significance of striatal changes were clarified with respect to acute pain thresholds: data across patients and controls revealed that striatal OpR availability was related to reduced pain perception. These findings are consistent with the view that chronic pain may upregulate OpR availability to dampen pain. Finally, patients with arthritis pain, compared with healthy controls, had overall less OpR availability within the striatum specifically, consistent with the greater endogenous opioid binding that would be expected in chronic pain states. Our observational evidence points to the need for further studies to establish the causal relationship between chronic pain states and OpR adaptation. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.;diprenorphine c 11- opiate- opiate receptor- tracer- unclassified drug- carbon- diprenorphine- narcotic antagonist- opiate receptor- oxygen- adult- anterior cingulate- arthritis- Article- brain blood flow- caudate nucleus- chronic pain- clinical article- controlled study- corpus striatum- correlation analysis- female- human- male- neuroimaging- nociception- osteoarthritis- pain assessment- pain threshold- periaqueductal gray matter- positron emission tomography- priority journal- protein expression- rheumatoid arthritis- thalamus- aged- arthritis- chronic pain- complication- corpus striatum- drug effects- hyperalgesia- metabolism- middle aged- nociception- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- pathology- pathophysiology- physiology- questionnaire- Adult- Aged- Arthritis- Carbon Radioisotopes- Chronic Pain- Corpus Striatum- Diprenorphine- Female- Humans- Hyperalgesia- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male- Middle Aged- Narcotic Antagonists- Oxygen Radioisotopes- Pain Perception- Pain Threshold- Periaqueductal Gray- Positron-Emission Tomography- Receptors, Opioid- Surveys and Questionnaires;English;Article

Standardized mathematical transformations, such as Fourier or polynomial transforms, could be extended toward TPS methods, on a basis, which properly encodes specific knowledge about a problem. Transition between methods is illustrated by comparing what happens in conventional Fourier transform with what happened during the development of Jewett Transform, reported in previous articles.

The method can be applied to any signal without knowing its analytical form. In the experiments, we have compared the proposed Grünwald-Letnikov computational fractional derivative method with the Riemman-Louville fractional derivative approach for two well-known functions. The simulations exhibit similar results for both methods- however, the Grünwald-Letnikov method outperforms the other approach in execution time.

In this growing complexity, it is essential to advance in the research and study of human organizations, as adaptive, complex systems. In order that human organizations should be able to engage the challenge of Complexity, it is important they be alerted and realize when disturbances occur. As social entities are self-disturbing systems, they require homeostatic mechanisms to restore their internal stability and balance in the changing scenarios. However, in certain circumstances, the self-regulating mechanisms may not be capable of effectively adapting the organization and the disturbances may get out of hand. This is the situation in which a systemic view and information is crucial for timely decision making through leadership and transformation. This paper is an exploratory study carried out applying the Systemic Management Model – MOSIG, which shows the social phenomena and related dynamics which register the political parties and movements in the Chilean historiography in a social destabilizing process and critical collapse, generating the breakdown of the democratic institutions. This research is a contribution, as it shows the elements which, in the anatomy of every crisis in its development phase, from the systemic view, in its growth phase, due to its destabilization and in its critical phase with its evolution or collapse. The findings in the behavioural patterns in the dynamic cycle, both external (scenario macro variables) and internal (management micro variables), allow the early detection of the social pathologies, their tracking and control for decision making within the management of time, according to pressure, urgency for conflict resolution.

Derivative approaches consider using Linear Combination of Derivatives (LCD) and Fractional Derivatives (FDPα). Four informed healthy subjects, aging 35.8 ±11.0 years old, agreed to perform Handgrip maneuvers. Signals are recorded continually- a Finapres NOVA device is used for fiAP, while a BIOPAC System is used for PPG and ECG. PPG is smoothed and segmented by heartbeat- recording sections interfered with spiky blocking noise, are eliminated. Finally, PPG is processed using LCD and FDPα and their results are enriched using Lasso technique. Twenty records per subject at rest and twenty at raised BP are analyzed. Results show PPG to fiAP fitting errors 5.38% ±0.91 at resting fiAP and 5.86% ±1.21 at raised fiAP, being always lower than 15%, suggesting that derivative approaches could be suitable for medical applications.

When the signal is periodic in time and/or space, classical compression processes like Fourier and wavelets transforms give good results concerning the compression rate, but bring in general no supplementary information about the interactions between elements of the living system producing the studied signal. Here, we define a new transform called dynalet based on Liénard differential equations susceptible to model the mechanism that is the source of the signal and we propose to apply this new technique to real signals like ECG, pulse activity and protein spectra in mass spectrometry. © 2013 IEEE.;Biological information- Compression process- Dynalets- Mass spectra- Pulse signal- Supplementary information- Wavelets- Wavelets transform- Differential equations- Fourier transforms- Mass spectrometry- Signal processing- Electrocardiography;English;Conference Paper

Ingeniería Biomédica., U. de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile- C.R.E.A, CNRS, École Polytechnique, París, France- DECOM, U. de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, Chile- Lab. TIMC-IMAG, UMR CNRS, University J. Fourier of Grenoble, La Tronche, France;A methodological proposal to estimate a Tailored to the Problem Specificity mathematical transformation is developed. To begin, Linear Analysis is briefly visited because of its significant role providing a unified vision of mathematical transformations. Thereafter it is explored the possibilities of extending this approach when basis of vector spaces are built tailored to the specific knowledge on a problem- not only from the convenience or effectiveness of mathematical calculations. Basis becomes not necessarily orthogonal neither linear. Standardized Mathematical Transformations such as Fourier or polynomial Transforms, could be extended, towards these new transformations. This was previously done to model Auditory Brainstem Responses using Jewett Transform. The proper use of Computational Intelligence tools was critical in this extension. It allowed important Complexity Algorithm optimization, which encourages the search for generalizing the methodology. In previous works, Artificial Neural Networks trained with backpropagation performed Jewett Transform. Mean Square Error in fitting Auditory Brainstem Responses to a model built using this transform are acceptable (mean ℰ< 0.3%, n= 600). The complexity of the best trained neural network algorithm was reduced to evaluate 100 inner products on 65 dimension vectors, 20 inner products on 100 dimension vectors and to calculate 120 sigmoid functions. Finally, using the trained Artificial Neural Network to estimate the Transform was thousands of times faster than using numerical gradient descent methods. © 2010 IEEE.;Artificial Neural Network- Auditory brainstem response- Complexity algorithms- Computational intelligence- Dimension vectors- Fourier- Inner product- Linear analysis- Mathematical calculations- Mathematical transform- Mathematical transforms- Non-Linearity- Nonorthogonal basis- Numerical gradient- Polynomial transform- Sigmoid function- Specific knowledge- Trained neural networks- Electric variables measurement- Linear transformations- Neural networks- Numerical methods- Vector spaces- Wavelet transforms- Mathematical transformations;English;Conference Paper

First ideas on this metaphor are from 1980 while monitoring cerebral function. It was conceived in contrast with Fourier Transform. Its application is limited to Auditory Brain Stem Responses. It uses a non-orthogonal physiologically rooted basis. Non-orthogonal basis has limited power in front of orthogonal basis: no analytical method exists to evaluate the corresponding transforms and numerical methods are required. In previous works, numerical methods were replaced for by trained artificial neural networks. Jewett transform was applied to increase the training set. Being a physiologically inspired basis, it promises better understanding of analysis of these evoked responses. It is envisioned that diverse new transforms, tailored to different problem specificity are to emerge. Considering the short temporal influence of Jewett components, it is stated that codifying temporal characteristics of Jewett components can be used to improve Jewett Transform. Previously used neural network was modified. Output vector codes are built up by grouping components instead of grouping parameters. This allows synaptic pruning in the artificial neural network. Only a fraction (0.49) of the previous network weights is used. Mean square error in fitting signal to model are acceptable (mean <0.3%, n= 600).

These devices are commonly the same as those used in hospitals by healthcare professionals. The use of these these devices by lay users outside of a clinical environment may become unsafe. This study presents a methodology that allows decision makers to identify potential risk situations that may arise when lay users operate healthcare medical devices at home. Through a usability study based on the Grounded Theory methodology, we create a conceptual model in which we identified problems and errors related to the use of a multi-parameter monitor in a home environment by a group of lay users. The conceptual model is reified as a graphical representation, which allows stakeholders to identify (i) the weaknesses of the device, (ii) unsafe operation modes, and (iii) the most suitable device for a specific user. © 2018 Reyes et al.

A large proportion of adults who survive such an accident can recover- however, this is achieved after going through a long process of kinesiology rehabilitation. In recent times, there are numerous advances in medical equipment, systems and applications that allow a progressive recovery from the consequences caused by this type of accident. The purpose of this work is to analyze the state of the art in which kinesiological rehabilitation technologies are found, through a systematic review of the literature, which also allows to determine the effectiveness of the application of these technologies in the recovery of patients. Motor rehabilitation technologies, based on virtual reality environments and robotic equipment, were identified for adult patients who present hemiparesis or hemiplegia. A great variation was found in the treatments and scales used for its evaluation, in the motor functionality of the upper and lower limb. In the case of robotic technologies, improvements in the range of motion of the limbs, gait and functionality of the upper limbs and muscular endurance stood out. Also, it highlights the adherence of patients to therapies with virtual reality technologies, since these were partly stimulating and enhanced positive aspects such as self-esteem. The work represents a contribution to engineers, who are interested in specializing in patient rehabilitation technologies. © 2021 IEEE.;Accidents- Process control- Recovery- Robotics- Virtual reality- Motor rehabilitation- Range of motions- Rehabilitation technology- Robotic equipments- Robotic technologies- Systematic Review- Virtual reality technology- Virtual-reality environment- Patient rehabilitation;Spanish;Conference Paper

Furthermore, the accessibility and customization of robotic rehabilitation devices is a key challenge. The purpose of this work was the design and construction of a prototype of passive rehabilitation for the upper limb, intended for the functional recovery of the wrist and hand on a patient with hypotonia and hemiplegia in his left limb, to be used at home. The developed device consists of a robotic system controlled through a Raspberry pi and implementation of two electric actuators, one to mobilize the flexion and extension of the wrist and another for the opening and closing of the hand. It also used a plate transmission system to execute the movements. 3D printing technology was used to produce most of the prototype parts, which were designed by computer. In addition, an interface was created to establish communication between the user and the device and to be able to choose modalities and time of the therapy, which was visualized by a 7-inch touch screen. After construction, the device was tested to verify its operation, obtaining as a result that it fulfilled the established objectives and executed the movements correctly within the stipulated time. Future work is expected to improve the structure and expand the device's exercise modalities and including miofeedback. © 2021 IEEE.;3D printers- Robotics- Touch screens- Customisation- Design and construction- Design and Development- Functional recovery- Motor rehabilitation- Patient's suffering- Rehabilitation devices- Robotic rehabilitation- Stroke- Upper limbs- Patient rehabilitation;Spanish;Conference Paper

This growing interest in games, with different objectives, justifies the investigation of some aspects and concepts involved, such as product quality (game), usability, playability, and user or player experience, topics investigated by the multidisciplinary area called Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Although the majority of users of these games are children and young people, an increasing number of older adults join technology and use different types of digital games. Several studies establish the increase in learning, socialization and exercise promotion, and cognitive and psychomotor skills improvement, all within the context of active and healthy aging. The objective of this work is to carry out a systematic literature review investigating the player experience of the elderly in digital games. The work allowed answering five research questions that were formulated. The evolution and maturity level of the research area are studied together with the research methods used. The factors that motivate adults to play were also analyzed- what are the recommended technical characteristics for games and some tools and metrics with which games are evaluated for older adults? Research gaps were detected in the area- there are not many specific studies on playability and player experience applied to the older adult, nor are there proven tools and metrics to evaluate them. Particular techniques for assessing and designing games focused on older adults are lacking, and quantitative studies that better identify the factors that affect the playability and experience of older adults in digital games. © 2020 by the authors.

The possibility of extending this approach is explored when basis of vector spaces is built Tailored to the Problem Specificity (TPS) and not from the convenience or effectiveness of mathematical calculations. Standardized mathematical transformations, such as Fourier or polynomial transforms, could be extended toward TPS methods, on a basis, which properly encodes specific knowledge about a problem. Transition between methods is illustrated by comparing what happens in conventional Fourier transform with what happened during the development of Jewett Transform, reported in previous articles. The proper use of computational intelligence tools to perform Jewett Transform allowed complexity algorithm optimization, which encourages the search for a general TPS methodology.

Valparaiso, Gran Bretana A., Chile;There is increasing evidence suggesting that glial cells play a crucial role in the formation and maturation of neural circuits. However, little is known about the effects of glial alterations on the establishment of functional circuitry in vivo during the development. The taiep rat, a long-lived neurological mutant characterized by early astrogliosis and demyelination affecting selectively the CNS, provides an interesting model to study the glia-neuron interaction in situ. In the present study, we evaluated the functional development of segmental neural circuits recording the monosynaptic reflex responses (MSR) in the isolated spinal cord of neonatal taiep rats. To evaluate the developmental changes during the first two postnatal weeks, we measured the latency of MSR, the magnitude of depression to paired pulses and the time course of post-tetanic recovery. During the early postnatal period, the MSR of control rats reduced their latency and decreased their sensitivity to depression, as a function of age. By contrast, the MSR of taiep rats failed to develop further from neonatal stage. Near the end of the second postnatal week, the MSR latencies were still prolonged, and the MSR showed a significantly stronger paired pulse depression, and higher post-tetanic recovery times than the age-matched controls. The lack of MSR maturation in taiep rats suggests an early alteration of functional mechanisms underlying the maturation of the spinal reflexes, probably due to the characteristic glial dysfunction(s) of this mutant. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Rod outer segments were on average 66.4 ± 11.2 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 104) in length and 6.6 ± 0.9 μm (mean ± S.D.) in diameter- 40 ± 22 photoisomerizations (mean ± S.D., range 10-99, n = 16) were required for eliciting a half-saturating photocurrent response. The time-to-peak was 911 ± 217 ms (mean ± S.D., n = 14, 20°C) in the linear range of the response and the integration time of the current response was 1744 ± 451 ms (mean ± S.D., n = 14). The time-to-peak appears to be slower and the integration time shorter in Caudiverbera than in Ambystoma tigrinum, Rana pipiens or Xenopus laevis rods under similar experimental conditions.

Most quality controls rely on routine tests using phantoms, which do not reflect closely the reality of images obtained on patients and do not reflect directly the quality perceived by radiologists. The purpose of this work is to develop a method that classifies the image quality perceived by radiologists in MR images. The focus was set on lumbar images as they are widely used with different challenges. Three neuroradiologists evaluated the image quality of a dataset that included T1-weighting images in axial and sagittal orientation, and sagittal T2-weighting. In parallel, we introduced the computational assessment using a wide range of features extracted from the images, then fed them into a classifier system. A total of 95 exams were used, from our local hospital and a public database, and part of the images was manipulated to broaden the distribution quality of the dataset. Good recall of 82% and an area under curve (AUC) of 77% were obtained on average in testing condition, using a Support Vector Machine. Even though the actual implementation still relies on user interaction to extract features, the results are promising with respect to a potential implementation for monitoring image quality online with the acquisition process. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite its becoming increasingly widespread, there is no specific way to perform a handstand, and the neuromuscular organizational mechanisms involved are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the muscle synergy of four handstand postures through a semblance analysis based on wavelets of electromyographic signals in the upper limbs of experienced circus performers between 18- and 35-year old. The results show that there is a large difference in positive and negative correlations depending on the posture, which suggests that the more asymmetrical the position of the lower limbs, the greater the number of strategies to maintain the posture. Although it is not a statistically significant data, it is observed that the posture 3 in particular, possesses the greatest number of positive correlations, which suggests it has the greatest synergy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Sports- Wavelet analysis- Electromyographic signal- Joint stabilities- Muscle synergies- Negative correlation- Organizational mechanisms- Positive correlations- Semblance analysis- Upper limbs- Muscle- article- athlete- body position- electromyography- human- lower limb- muscle- upper limb- adolescent- adult- electromyography- skeletal muscle- wavelet analysis- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Athletes- Electromyography- Humans- Muscle, Skeletal- Posture- Wavelet Analysis- Young Adult;English;Article

In addition, the greater number of these models have a rigid architecture which prevents the incremental learning of new classes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the Self-Improving Generative Artificial Neural Network (SIGANN), an end-to-end deep neural network system which can ease the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning new classes. In this method, we introduce a novel detection model that automatically detects samples of new classes, and an adversarial autoencoder is used to produce samples of previous classes. This system consists of three main modules: a classifier module implemented using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, a generator module based on an adversarial autoencoder, and a novelty-detection module implemented using an OpenMax activation function. Using the EMNIST data set, the model was trained incrementally, starting with a small set of classes. The results of the simulation show that SIGANN can retain previous knowledge while incorporating gradual forgetfulness of each learning sequence at a rate of about 7% per training step. Moreover, SIGANN can detect new classes that are hidden in the data with a median accuracy of 43% and, therefore, proceed with incremental class learning. © 2019 by the authors.;Deep learning- Neural networks- Activation functions- Catastrophic forgetting problem- Convolutional neural network- Detection models- Incremental learning- Learning sequences- Neural network systems- Novelty detection- Deep neural networks;English;Article

The first method, named ""multichannel EEG thresholding by similarity"" (METS), simultaneously denoises all of the information recorded by the channels. The second approach, named ""semblance-based ERP window selection"" (SEWS), presents two versions to automatically localize the ERP in time for each subject to reduce the time window to be analysed by removing useless features. We empirically show that when these methods are used independently, they are suitable for ERP denoising and feature extraction. Meanwhile, the combination of both methods obtains better results compared to using them independently. The denoising algorithm was compared with classic thresholding methods based on wavelets and was found to obtain better results, which shows its suitability for ERP processing. The combination of the two algorithms for denoising the signals and selecting the time window has been compared to xDAWN, which is an efficient algorithm to enhance ERPs. We conclude that our wavelet-based semblance method performs better than xDAWN for single-trial detection in the presence of artifacts or noise. © 2019 Saavedra Ruiz Carolina Veronica et al.";Computation theory- Computer science- Mathematical techniques- De-noising algorithm- Event-related potentials- Multichannel EEG- Similarity measure- Thresholding- Thresholding methods- Wavelet domain- Window selection- Feature extraction- algorithm- artifact- brain- computer simulation- electroencephalography- evoked response- human- physiology- procedures- signal processing- Algorithms- Artifacts- Brain- Computer Simulation- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Humans- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

In the experiments, we have compared the proposed Grünwald-Letnikov computational fractional derivative method with the Riemman-Louville fractional derivative approach for two well-known functions.

Signals are recorded continually- a Finapres NOVA device is used for fiAP, while a BIOPAC System is used for PPG and ECG. PPG is smoothed and segmented by heartbeat- recording sections interfered with spiky blocking noise, are eliminated. Finally, PPG is processed using LCD and FDPα and their results are enriched using Lasso technique. Twenty records per subject at rest and twenty at raised BP are analyzed. Results show PPG to fiAP fitting errors 5.38% ±0.91 at resting fiAP and 5.86% ±1.21 at raised fiAP, being always lower than 15%, suggesting that derivative approaches could be suitable for medical applications.

One of the simplest solutions to this issue is adding samples of previous data, with the drawback of increasingly having to store training data- or generating patterns that evoke similar responses of the previous task. We propose a model using a Recurrent Neural Network-based image generator in order to provide a Deep Convolutional Network a limited number of samples for new training data. Simulation results shows that our proposal is able to retain previous knowledge whenever some few pseudo-samples of previously recorded patterns are generated. Despite having lower performance than giving the network samples of the real dataset, this model is more biologically plausible and might help to reduce the need of storing previously trained data on bigger-scale classification classification models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;Classification (of information)- Convolution- Deep learning- Neural networks- Neurology- Recurrent neural networks- Catastrophic forgetting- Classification models- Computational neuroscience- Connectionist models- Convolutional networks- Convolutional neural network- Incremental learning- Stability-plasticity dilemma- Deep neural networks;English;Conference Paper

This paper presents a new adaptive approach to denoise signals taking into account channels correlation in the wavelet domain. Moreover, we combine phase and amplitude information in the wavelet domain to automatically select a temporal window which increases class separability.

However, one of the major drawbacks in the application of artificial neural networks is the difficulty to properly specify the structure of the lattice that best preserves the topology of the data. To overcome this problem, in this paper we introduce merging algorithms for machine-fusion, boosting-fusion-based and hybrid-fusion ensembles of SOM, NG and GSOM networks.

In this paper we show that when deviations from idealized distribution function assumptions occur, the behavior of the Neural Gas model can be drastically affected and will not preserve the topology of the feature space as desired. In particular, we show that the learning algorithm of the NG is sensitive to the presence of outliers due to their influence over the adaptation step. We incorporate a robust strategy to the learning algorithm based on M-estimators where the influence of outlying observations are bounded.

However, rainfall can be measured from different meteorological stations, and runoff forecasting can be biased. Thus, the aim of this work is to propose a new stacking neuro-fuzzy framework for predicting runoff from physically distributed meteorological stations. As a method to estimate single one-day-ahead runoff and as a stacking approach, the Self-Identification Neuro-fuzzy Inference model (SINFIM) and Self-Organizing Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (SONFIS) were developed, respectively. As a case study, data from two Chilean watersheds (the Diguillín River (Ñuble region) and Colorado River (Maule region)) and average daily runoff and average daily rainfall recorded over eighteen years were collected from the Chilean Directorate of Water Resources (DGA). The experimental results show good adjustment in the single forecasting of runoff with meteorological stations showing adjustment and efficiency indexes of greater than 80% in the validation set and being able to efficiently predict both high and low runoff values. However, better results were obtained with the stacking model with values being higher than single runoff predictions and those of state-of-art approaches. Therefore, the general framework proposed represents a good approach for forecasting runoff since it can improve predictions and generate more accurate runoff values than single models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Fuzzy inference- Fuzzy neural networks- Fuzzy systems- Rain- Weather forecasting- Day-ahead- Degree of uncertainty- Fuzzy frameworks- Hydrological phenomenon- Meteorological station- Neuro-Fuzzy- Neuro-fuzzy modeling- Runoff forecasting- Stacking models- Stackings- Runoff;English;Article

The possibility of extending this approach is explored when basis of vector spaces is built Tailored to the Problem Specificity (TPS) and not from the convenience or effectiveness of mathematical calculations. Standardized mathematical transformations, such as Fourier or polynomial transforms, could be extended toward TPS methods, on a basis, which properly encodes specific knowledge about a problem. Transition between methods is illustrated by comparing what happens in conventional Fourier transform with what happened during the development of Jewett Transform, reported in previous articles. The proper use of computational intelligence tools to perform Jewett Transform allowed complexity algorithm optimization, which encourages the search for a general TPS methodology.

Most machine learning tools make a one-level classification for white blood cell classification. This work presents a two-stage hybrid multi-level scheme that efficiently classifies four cell groups: lymphocytes and monocytes (mononuclear) and segmented neutrophils and eosinophils (polymorphonuclear). At the first level, a Faster R-CNN network is applied for the identification of the region of interest of white blood cells, together with the separation of mononuclear cells from polymorphonuclear cells. Once separated, two parallel convolutional neural networks with the MobileNet structure are used to recognize the subclasses in the second level. The results obtained using Monte Carlo cross-validation show that the proposed model has a performance metric of around 98.4% (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score). The proposed model represents a good alternative for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for supporting the pathologist in the clinical laboratory in assessing white blood cells from blood smear images. © 2022 by the authors.

Biomédica, Universidad de Valparaíso, General Cruz 222, Valparaíso, Valparaíso, 2362905, Chile- Millennium Institute for Intelligent Healthcare Engineering, Santiago, Chile;Rainfall forecasting is an important input for decision-making in multiple areas, such as water resource planning and management associated with agriculture, hydropower generation, hydration in soils, and reducing vulnerability and risk in the integration of the corresponding systems. However, due to the spatial-temporal variability of rainfall amounts, it is very difficult to achieve high precision in the forecasts. This research addresses the challenge of rainfall forecasting by proposing the application of a methodology based on a combination of techniques within the framework of wavelet decomposition principles, the machine learning approach, and a lagged regression model. We implemented wavelet decomposition in a preprocessing phase followed by the use of a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and proposed a prediction enhancement phase in which the outputs were optimized by algorithms for monthly rainfall forecast corrections. The methodology was implemented at four weather stations in Venezuela, and it was compared with transfer function models, multiple regression and other powerful forecasting methods. The research results suggest that our approach improved the performance accuracy by correcting rainfall forecasting biases, achieving adjusted coefficients of determination greater than 0.76 and normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) values less than 0.31. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Decision making- Long short-term memory- Rain- Regression analysis- Tropics- Weather forecasting- Decisions makings- El Nino phenomena- Machine-learning- Monthly rainfalls- Multiple areas- Rainfall forecasting- Tropical regions- Water resources planning and managements- Wavelet- Wavelets decomposition- Wavelet decomposition;English;Article

Maternal hyperglycaemia in GDM results in fetoplacental endothelial dysfunction. GDM-harmful effects result from chronic and short periods of hyperglycaemia. Thus, it is determinant to keep glycaemia within physiological ranges avoiding short but repetitive periods of hyper or hypoglycaemia. The variation of glycaemia over time is defined as ‘glycaemia dynamics’. The latter concept regards with a variety of mechanisms and environmental conditions leading to blood glucose handling. In this review we summarized the different metrics for glycaemia dynamics derived from quantitative, plane distribution, amplitude, score values, variability estimation, and time series analysis. The potential application of the derived metrics from self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the potential alterations of pregnancy outcome in GDM are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;adult- area under the curve- blood glucose monitoring- case report- clinical article- endothelial dysfunction- fetus growth- food intake- glucose blood level- human- hyperglycemia- hypoglycemia- insulin dependent diabetes mellitus- insulin sensitivity- male- non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus- obesity- oxidative stress- physical activity- pregnancy diabetes mellitus- pregnancy outcome- pregnant woman- Review- time series analysis- female- glucose blood level- hyperglycemia- newborn- pregnancy- Blood Glucose- Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring- Diabetes, Gestational- Female- Humans- Hyperglycemia- Infant, Newborn- Pregnancy;English;Review

Therefore, there is a need for new hemodynamic biomarkers to refine disease monitoring and improve patient risk stratification. This research aims to analyze and extract multiple correlation patterns of hemodynamic parameters from 4D Flow MRI data and find which parameters allow an accurate classification between healthy volunteers (HV) and BAV patients with dilated and non-dilated ascending aorta using machine learning. Sixteen hemodynamic parameters were calculated in the ascending aorta (AAo) and aortic arch (AArch) at peak systole from 4D Flow MRI. We used sequential forward selection (SFS) and principal component analysis (PCA) as feature selection algorithms. Then, eleven machine-learning classifiers were implemented to separate HV and BAV patients (non- and dilated ascending aorta). Multiple correlation patterns from hemodynamic parameters were extracted using hierarchical clustering. The linear discriminant analysis and random forest are the best performing classifiers, using five hemodynamic parameters selected with SFS (velocity angle, forward velocity, vorticity, and backward velocity in AAo- and helicity density in AArch) a 96.31 ± 1.76% and 96.00 ± 0.83% accuracy, respectively. Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of correlated features. According to this analysis, we observed that features selected by SFS have a better performance than those selected by PCA because the five selected parameters were distributed according to 3 different clusters. Based on the proposed method, we concluded that the feature selection method found five potentially hemodynamic biomarkers related to this disease. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Blood vessels- Decision trees- Discriminant analysis- Feature extraction- Hemodynamics- Machine learning- Medical imaging- Principal component analysis- Bicuspid aortic valves- Correlation patterns- Features selection- Haemodynamics- Healthy volunteers- Hemodynamic biomarker- Hemodynamic parameters- Multiple correlation- Principal-component analysis- Sequential forward selection- Biomarkers- biological marker- biological marker- adult- aortic arch- aortic diameter- aortic root- artery dilatation- ascending aorta- bicuspid aortic valve- cardiovascular magnetic resonance- classifier- clinical feature- controlled study- cross validation- demography- diagnostic accuracy- disease classification- feature selection algorithm- female- four-dimensional imaging- heart contraction- hemodynamic parameters- hemodynamics- hierarchical clustering- human- Letter- machine learning- major clinical study- male- measurement accuracy- middle aged- morphotype- random forest- sensitivity and specificity- systole- velocity- aortic valve- diagnostic imaging- dilatation- hemodynamics- machine learning- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- procedures- valvular heart disease- Aortic Valve- Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease- Biomarkers- Dilatation- Heart Valve Diseases- Hemodynamics- Humans- Machine Learning- Magnetic Resonance Imaging;English;Letter

Recently, various technological tools have emerged to assist patients with GDM to meet glycemic goals and facilitate constant glucose monitoring, making these tasks more straightforward and comfortable. Objective: To evaluate the impact of remote monitoring technologies in assisting patients with GDM to achieve glycemic goals, and know the respective advantages and disadvantages when it comes to reducing risk during pregnancy, both for the mother and her child. Methods: A total of 188 articles were obtained with the keywords “gestational diabetes mellitus,” “GDM,” “gestational diabetes,” added to the evaluation levels associated with “glucose level,” “glycemia,” “glycemic index,” “blood sugar,” and the technological proposal to evaluate with “glucometerm” “mobile application,” “mobile applications,” “technological tools,” “telemedicine,” “technovigilance,” “wearable” published during the period 2016–2021, excluding postpartum studies, from three scientific databases: PUBMED, Scopus and Web of Science. These were managed in the Mendeley platform and classified using the PRISMA method. Results: A total of 28 articles were selected after elimination according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main measurement was glycemia and 4 medical devices were found (glucometer: conventional, with an infrared port, with Bluetooth, Smart type and continuous glucose monitor), which together with digital technology allow specific functions through 2 identified digital platforms (mobile applications and online systems). In four articles, the postprandial glucose was lower in the Tele-GDM groups than in the control group. Benefits such as improved glycemic control, increased satisfaction and acceptability, maternal confidence, decreased gestational weight gain, knowledge of GDM, and other relevant aspects were observed. There were also positive comments regarding the optimization of the medical team’s time. Conclusion: The present review offers the opportunity to know about the respective advantages and disadvantages of remote monitoring technologies when it comes to reducing risk during pregnancy. GDM centered technology may help to evaluate outcomes and tailor personalized solutions to contribute to women’s health. More studies are needed to know the impact on a healthcare system.

The issue is not trivial and the question remains as to how the dose management is managed, specifically, in Chile. The objective of this work is to record and synthesize doses to patient undergoing CT examination in three institutions in the Valparaíso Region. A prospective descriptive study was carried out for 3 months, including examinations of the head, thorax and pelvis. DICOM files were collected to extract relevant variable values. Dose distributions are different between hospitals, as they have different equipment installed and different acquisition protocols. The median CTDI (Computed Tomography Dose Index) observed are in general within the international range, with a large proportion of exams exceeding these values. The most relevant variables in dose control were the number of series associated with each exam, and the tube current. This study shows that patient doses in these three institutions are consistent with what has been reported internationally, with some room for improvement still available. It remains to be confirmed whether these conclusions can be extended to other institutions and other regions of Chile. © 2022 Sociedad Chilena de Radiología.;adult- article- Chile- computer assisted tomography- controlled study- digital imaging and communications in medicine- female- human- ionizing radiation- male- pelvis- prospective study- radiation dose- radiation dose distribution- thorax- X ray;Spanish;Article

However, few studies have evaluated temporal changes in the electromyographic activity (EMG) of lower limb muscles during running. The aim of this study was to compare temporal changes in EMG amplitude between RF and FF running techniques. Eleven recreational runners ran on a treadmill at a self-selected speed, once using a RF strike pattern and once using a FF strike pattern (randomized order). The EMG of five lower limb muscles [rectus femoris (RFe), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG)] was evaluated, using bipolar electrodes. EMG data from the RF and FF running techniques was then processed and compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), dividing the analysis of the running cycle into stance and swing phases. The MG and LG muscles showed higher activation during FF running at the beginning of the stance phase and at the end of the swing phase. During the end of the swing phase, the TA muscle's EMG amplitude was higher, when the RF running technique was used. A higher level of co-activation between the gastrocnemius and TA muscles was observed in both stance and swing phases using RF. The myoelectric behaviour of the RFe and BF muscles was similar during both running techniques. The current findings highlight that the two running techniques predominately reflect adjustments of the shank and not the thigh muscles, in both phases of the running cycle. Highlights Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) can reveal temporal differences in muscle activity between running techniques. The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were more active at specific time-instants of the initial stance and late swing phases during forefoot (FF) running compared to rearfoot (RF) running. Higher activation was observed for the tibialis anterior muscle at the end of the swing phase during RF running Contrary to the muscle activity differences observed in the leg muscles, the muscle activity of the thigh muscles was similar during RF and FF running. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.;-;English;Article

Machine learning methods have been features of several tools in the fields of obstetrics and childcare. This present review aims to summarize the machine learning techniques to predict perinatal complications. Objective: To identify the applicability and performance of machine learning methods used to identify pregnancy complications. Methods: A total of 98 articles were obtained with the keywords “machine learning,” “deep learning,” “artificial intelligence,” and accordingly as they related to perinatal complications (“complications in pregnancy,” “pregnancy complications”) from three scientific databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. These were managed on the Mendeley platform and classified using the PRISMA method. Results: A total of 31 articles were selected after elimination according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The features used to predict perinatal complications were primarily electronic medical records (48%), medical images (29%), and biological markers (19%), while 4% were based on other types of features, such as sensors and fetal heart rate. The main perinatal complications considered in the application of machine learning thus far are pre-eclampsia and prematurity. In the 31 studies, a total of sixteen complications were predicted. The main precision metric used is the AUC. The machine learning methods with the best results were the prediction of prematurity from medical images using the support vector machine technique, with an accuracy of 95.7%, and the prediction of neonatal mortality with the XGBoost technique, with 99.7% accuracy. Conclusion: It is important to continue promoting this area of research and promote solutions with multicenter clinical applicability through machine learning to reduce perinatal complications. This systematic review contributes significantly to the specialized literature on artificial intelligence and women’s health.

A problem with this level of complexity needs to be faced with integral approaches, which involves the complement of numerical quantitative analysis with other types of analysis. This study uses a novel visual-predictive data analysis approach to obtain relevant information regarding the academic performance of students from a Peruvian university. This approach joins together domain understanding and data-visualization analysis, with the construction of machine learning models in order to provide a visual-predictive model of the students’ academic success. Specifically, a trained XGBoost Machine Learning model achieved a performance of up to 91.5% Accuracy. The results obtained alongside a visual data analysis allow us to identify the relevant variables associated with the students’ academic performances. In this study, this novel approach was found to be a valuable tool for developing and targeting policies to support students with lower academic performance or to stimulate advanced students. Moreover, we were able to give some insight into the academic situation of the different careers of the university. © 2022 by the authors.;-;English;Article

Neuro-fuzzy models have emerged as a useful approach, given the ability of neural networks to optimize parameters in a fuzzy system. In this work a Self-Identification Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Model (SINFIM) for modeling the relationship between rainfall and runoff on a Chilean watershed is proposed to reduce the uncertainty of selecting both the rainfall and runoff lags and the number of membership functions required in a fuzzy system. The data comes from the Diguillín river located in Ñuble region and average daily runoff and average daily rainfall recorded from years 2000 to 2018, according to the Chilean directorate of water resources (DGA). In addition, we worked with the Colorado River basin, located in the Maule region, to validate the method developed. The experimental results showed a good adjustment using the last 3 years as validation set, further improvement was achieved using only the last year was used as validation test, obtaining 84% of R2 and 0,91 Kling Gupta Efficiency, higher than other forecasting models such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial neural networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach. In addition, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent BIAS indicate the method is a promising model. On the other hand, even better results were obtained in the validation basin, whose adjustment was 94% and an efficiency of 97%. Therefore, the proposed model is a solid alternative to forecast the runoff in a given watershed, obtaining good performance measurements, managing to predict both the low and peak runoff values from rainfall events, avoiding the requirement to determine a priori the lags of time series and the number of fuzzy rules. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Efficiency- Forecasting- Fuzzy neural networks- Fuzzy systems- Long short-term memory- Membership functions- Rain- Runoff- Uncertainty analysis- Watersheds- Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system- Colorado River Basin- Forecasting models- Model rainfall-runoff- Neuro-Fuzzy model- Performance measurements- Rainfall and runoffs- Validation test- Fuzzy inference- algorithm- hydrological modeling- rainfall- rainfall-runoff modeling- runoff- watershed- Chile- Colorado Basin [North America];English;Article

Biomédica, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, 2362905, Chile- Instituto de Estadística, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, 2360102, Chile;Lima is considered one of the cities with the highest air pollution in Latin America. Institutions such as DIGESA, PROTRANSPORTE and SENAMHI are in charge of permanently monitoring air quality- therefore, the air quality visualization system must manage large amounts of data of different concentrations. In this study, a spatio-temporal visualization approach was developed for the exploration of data of the PM10 concentration in Metropolitan Lima, where the spatial behavior, at different time scales, of hourly concentrations of PM10 are analyzed using basic and specialized charts. The results show that the stations located to the east side of the metropolitan area had the highest concentrations, in contrast to the stations located in the center and north that reported better air quality. According to the temporal variation, the station with the highest average of biannual and annual PM10 was the HCH station. The highest PM10 concentrations were registered in 2018, during the summer, highlighting the month of March with daily averages that reached 435 µg/m3 . During the study period, the CRB was the station that recorded the lowest concentrations and the only one that met the Environmental Quality Standard for air quality. The proposed approach exposes a sequence of steps for the elaboration of charts with increasingly specific time periods according to their relevance, and a statistical analysis, such as the dynamic temporal correlation, that allows to obtain a detailed visualization of the spatio-temporal variations of PM10 concentrations. Furthermore, it was concluded that the meteorological variables do not indicate a causal relationship with respect to PM10 levels, but rather that the concentrations of particulate material are related to the urban characteristics of each district. © 2021 by the authors.

This work evaluates and predicts the Spatio-temporal behavior of air quality in Metropolitan Lima, Peru, using artificial neural networks. The conventional feedforward backpropagation known as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Recurrent Artificial Neural network known as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) were implemented for the hourly prediction of PM 10 based on the past values of this pollutant and three meteorological variables obtained from five monitoring stations. The models were validated using two schemes: The Hold-Out and the Blocked-Nested Cross-Validation (BNCV). The simulation results show that periods of moderate PM 10 concentration are predicted with high precision. Whereas, for periods of high contamination, the performance of both models, the MLP and LSTM, were diminished. On the other hand, the prediction performance improved slightly when the models were trained and validated with the BNCV scheme. The simulation results showed that the models obtained a good performance for the CDM, CRB, and SMP monitoring stations, characterized by a moderate to low level of contamination. However, the results show the difficulty of predicting this contaminant in those stations that present critical contamination episodes, such as ATE and HCH. In conclusion, the LSTM recurrent artificial neural networks with BNCV adapt more precisely to critical pollution episodes and have better predictability performance for this type of environmental data. © 2021, The Author(s).;air quality- article- back propagation- contamination- forecasting- long short term memory network- multilayer perceptron- nested cross validation- particulate matter 10- Peru- prediction- simulation- pollutant;English;Article

This study aims to identify genes potentially implicated with CAVS in patients with congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) in comparison with patients having normal valves, using a knowledge-slanted random forest (RF). Results: This study implemented a knowledge-slanted random forest (RF) using information extracted from a protein-protein interactions network to rank genes in order to modify their selection probability to draw the candidate split-variables. A total of 15,191 genes were assessed in 19 valves with CAVS (BAV, n = 10- TAV, n = 9) and 8 normal valves. The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to discriminate cases with CAVS. A comparison with conventional RF was also performed. The performance of this proposed approach reported improved accuracy in comparison with conventional RF to classify cases separately with BAV and TAV (Slanted RF: 59.3% versus 40.7%). When patients with BAV and TAV were grouped against patients with normal valves, the addition of prior biological information was not relevant with an accuracy of 92.6%. Conclusion: The knowledge-slanted RF approach reflected prior biological knowledge, leading to better precision in distinguishing between cases with BAV, TAV, and normal valves. The results of this study suggest that the integration of biological knowledge can be useful during difficult classification tasks. © 2021, The Author(s).;-;English;Article

Most quality controls rely on routine tests using phantoms, which do not reflect closely the reality of images obtained on patients and do not reflect directly the quality perceived by radiologists. The purpose of this work is to develop a method that classifies the image quality perceived by radiologists in MR images. The focus was set on lumbar images as they are widely used with different challenges. Three neuroradiologists evaluated the image quality of a dataset that included T1-weighting images in axial and sagittal orientation, and sagittal T2-weighting. In parallel, we introduced the computational assessment using a wide range of features extracted from the images, then fed them into a classifier system. A total of 95 exams were used, from our local hospital and a public database, and part of the images was manipulated to broaden the distribution quality of the dataset. Good recall of 82% and an area under curve (AUC) of 77% were obtained on average in testing condition, using a Support Vector Machine. Even though the actual implementation still relies on user interaction to extract features, the results are promising with respect to a potential implementation for monitoring image quality online with the acquisition process. © 2021 by the authors.

The first module considers the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequences (ETAS) model for estimating the intensity function, which will be used for estimating the seismic rate on a 1 × 1 degree grid providing a sequence of daily images covering all the seismic area of Chile. The spatial and temporal estimation module uses the LSTM and CNN for predicting the intensity and the location of earthquakes. The last module integrates the information provided by the DNNs for predicting future values of the maximum seismic rate and their location. In particular, the LSTM will be trained using the maximum intensity of the last 30 days as input for predicting the maximum intensity of the next day, and the CNN will be trained on the last 30 images provided by the application of the ETAS model for predicting the probability that the next day the maximum event will be in certain area of Chile. Some performance indexes (such as R2 and accuracy) will be used for validating the proposed models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;-;English;Article

Although social networks such as Twitter are a rich and up-to-date source of information where users use to tweet about different topics, it is complex to efficiently and effectively obtain results that support decision-making on a specific subject, such as cyberattacks. Therefore, in this work, we propose to use an offline mining process based on the clique percolation method over a corpus of tweets in order to generate an indexed knowledge base about cyberattacks. Results are promising to observe threats under evolution.

Despite its becoming increasingly widespread, there is no specific way to perform a handstand, and the neuromuscular organizational mechanisms involved are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the muscle synergy of four handstand postures through a semblance analysis based on wavelets of electromyographic signals in the upper limbs of experienced circus performers between 18- and 35-year old. The results show that there is a large difference in positive and negative correlations depending on the posture, which suggests that the more asymmetrical the position of the lower limbs, the greater the number of strategies to maintain the posture. Although it is not a statistically significant data, it is observed that the posture 3 in particular, possesses the greatest number of positive correlations, which suggests it has the greatest synergy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Sports- Wavelet analysis- Electromyographic signal- Joint stabilities- Muscle synergies- Negative correlation- Organizational mechanisms- Positive correlations- Semblance analysis- Upper limbs- Muscle- article- athlete- body position- electromyography- human- lower limb- muscle- upper limb- adolescent- adult- electromyography- skeletal muscle- wavelet analysis- young adult- Adolescent- Adult- Athletes- Electromyography- Humans- Muscle, Skeletal- Posture- Wavelet Analysis- Young Adult;English;Article

Universitat 1, 43204 Reus, Spain.;Cryptocurrencies have been receiving the sustained attention of investors since 2009. These new investment vehicles are digitally native, meaning that they are traded exclusively on 24/7 digital platforms. Consequently, they offer an excellent scenario to test the Efficient Market Hypothesis, by developing algorithm-based trading strategies. Such strategies aim to beat the market. It has been previously reported that daily returns do not exhibit long range dependence. However, daily volatility in major cryptocurrencies is highly persistent. Therefore, buy/hold/sell decision support systems could be able to capture such market inefficiency. This is especially important for investors interested in periodically trading a set of cryptocurrencies, in order to maximize their wealth. This paper presents a dynamic linguistic decision making approach for building decision models to support cryptocurrency investors in buy/hold/sell decisions. This approach exhibits a good computational performance for obtaining recommendations based on quantitative data. Moreover, this procedure is able to identify some inefficient cryptocurrency behaviors which are not captured by traditional econometric techniques. Our results uncover arbitrage opportunities that outperform buy-and-hold or random strategies.

Biomédica, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chacabuco 2092-2220, Valparaíso, Chile;Electric power forecasting plays a substantial role in the administration and balance of current power systems. For this reason, accurate predictions of service demands are needed to develop better programming for the generation and distribution of power and to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the integration of an electric power system. For the purposes of the current study, a systematic literature review was applied to identify the type of model that has the highest propensity to show precision in the context of electric power forecasting. The state-of-the-art model in accurate electric power forecasting was determined from the results reported in 257 accuracy tests from five geographic regions. Two classes of forecasting models were compared: classical statistical or mathematical (MSC) and machine learning (ML) models. Furthermore, the use of hybrid models that have made significant contributions to electric power forecasting is identified, and a case of study is applied to demonstrate its good performance when compared with traditional models. Among our main findings, we conclude that forecasting errors are minimized by reducing the time horizon, that ML models that consider various sources of exogenous variability tend to have better forecast accuracy, and finally, that the accuracy of the forecasting models has significantly increased over the last five years. © 2020 by the authors.

Biomédica, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile;Metacarpophalangeal deviations can be present from congenital diseases, nerve injuries, direct trauma such as fractures, autoimmune arthropathies such as that associated with lupus erythematosus (Jaccoud), to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is an inflammatory disease of joint components with varying degrees of destruction of the small joints of hands, producing a deformation that is evidenced in the deviation of the axis of the fingers having an impact on the functionality of the hand. The application of computational vision and machine learning in the quantification of finger angulation and joint thickening, can provide an objective way to record measures that are routinely performed subjectively if there is no specialized equipment. These measurements can be very useful to have an adequate pre and post intervention record or simply have a standardized record in the case of degenerative pathologies. Through digital image processing, it is possible to define markers that allow us to calculate the angulation and width of the metacarpophalangeal segments at the service of the clinic or useful in research.

Twenty-two subjects underwent three types of tasks: counting, reading and rest, accompanied by a constant stimulus. Images were obtained from the Inter Trial phase coherence (ITPC) to train classification algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to separate the tasks performed by the subjects. Performance evaluation of the classification algorithm shows very good separation between count, read and rest with an AUROC of 0.95.

Digital transformation of the states is a public initiative to adapt public processes of institutions to the new digital reality, and in this way, to adapt public processes of institutions to improve the generation of public values. As well as a public value is co-constructed by different institutions, the transformation of an institution may impact (positively or negatively) different public values. Unfortunately, digital transformation has not considered the impact (positive or negative) of the transformation of the process on all public values impacted by transformation, but motivation is put in specific focuses. In this paper, we propose a group decision-making framework to prioritize, as a group, all public values in order to obtain as an outcome, the prioritized list of digital transformation initiatives aligned to the development of the country. We present an illustrative example based on the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF), where we discuss what would be the most important initiatives if our proposal were used. © 2020 ACM.;Decision making- e-government- Development impacts- Digital transformation- Example based- Group Decision Making- Public management- Public values- Social values- Well being- Public administration;English;Conference Paper

The classic fMRI analysis pipeline is based on the assumption that the hemodynamic response (HR) is the same across brain regions, time, and subjects. Although convenient, there is ample evidence that this assumption does not hold, and that these differences result in inaccuracies in brain activity detection. This article presents a new fMRI processing pipeline that captures the intrinsic intra-and intersubject variability of the HR. At the core of this new pipeline is the definition of a fuzzy hemodynamic response function (HRF). The proposed pipeline includes a new fuzzy general linear model (GLM) able to handle the fuzzy HRF, including a practical realization based on the LR representation of fuzzy numbers. This article also describes how to obtain activation maps from the fuzzy GLM, and a methodology to compute the statistical power of the analysis. The method is evaluated in synthetic and real fMRI data and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments based on synthetic data show that the fuzzy GLM approach is more robust under uncertainty regarding the true specific shape of the HR. The experiments based on the real data show an increased volume of the activated brain areas, suggesting that the proposed method is able to prevent false negative errors in the boundaries of target brain regions in which HR should be negligible. © 1993-2012 IEEE.;Activation analysis- Brain- Fuzzy rules- Hemodynamics- Magnetic resonance imaging- Magnetism- Pipelines- Resonance- False negative errors- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- Fuzzy numbers- General linear modeling- Hemodynamic response- Hemodynamic response functions- Neuroimaging techniques- State-of-the-art techniques- Functional neuroimaging;English;Article

Nevertheless, there is no clear reference protocol for its implementation- one of the questions being which b-value distribution to use. This study aimed to stress the importance of the sampling scheme and to show that an optimized b-value distribution decreases the variance associated with IVIM parameters in the brain with respect to a regular distribution in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten volunteers were included in this study- images were acquired on a 1.5T MR scanner. Two distributions of 16 b-values were used: one considered ‘regular’ due to its close association with that used in other studies, and the other considered ‘optimized’ according to previous studies. IVIM parameters were adjusted according to the bi-exponential model, using two-step method. Analysis was undertaken in ROI defined using in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas, and parameters distributions were compared in a total of 832 ROI. Results: Maps with fewer speckles were obtained with the ‘optimized’ distribution. Coefficients of varia-tion did not change significantly for the estimation of the diffusion coefficient D but decreased by approx-imately 39% for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient estimation and by 21% for the perfusion fraction. Distributions of adjusted parameters were found significantly different in 50% of the cases for the perfusion fraction, in 80% of the cases for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient and 17% of the cases for the diffusion coefficient. Observations across brain areas show that the range of average values for IVIM parameters is smaller in the ‘optimized’ case. Conclusion: Using an optimized distribution, data are sampled in a way that the IVIM signal decay is better described and less variance is obtained in the fitted parameters. The increased precision gained could help to detect small variations in IVIM parameters. © 2019 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.;brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- human- image processing- movement (physiology)- physiology- procedures- Brain- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Movement;English;Article

However, there is limited evidence of the electromyographic (EMG) activity for both conditions. The aim of this study was to compare the lower limb muscles EMG amplitude between RF and FF techniques during running. Thirteen runners were evaluated at a self-selected running speed under two conditions: initial contact with RF and FF. The myoelectric activity of the rectus femoris (RE), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (GM) and lateral (GL) were analysed. The EMG amplitudes of 10 running cycles were averaged and normalized to the maximum voluntary contraction. The results included a significantly higher activation of GM and GL muscles for the FF condition during the stance phase, balance and the entire running cycle. In addition, TA showed higher activation during the swing phase and the 100% running cycle for the RP condition. No other significant differences were found. In conclusion, FF technique increases GM and GL myoelectric activity, possibly associated with a higher impact absorption during the stance phase. On the other hand, TA increases its activity for RF condition which may imply a greater neuromuscular control prior to initial contact. Finally, the running technique is presented as a modifiable condition which can be changed to enhance performance or in pathologic circumstances. © 2020 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

Biomédica, Universidad de Valparaíso, Valparaíso, 2391415, Chile- Department of Statistics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL  61820, United States;It is well known that environmental fluctuations and fishing efforts modify fishing patterns in various parts of the world. One of the most affected areas is northern Chile. The reduction of the gaps in the implementation of national fisheries' management policies and the basic knowledge that supports the making of such decisions are crucial. That is why in this research, a transfer function method with variable coefficients is proposed to forecast monthly disembarkation of anchovies and sardines in northern Chile, taking into account the incidence of large-scale climatic variables on landings. The method uses a least squares procedure and wavelets to expand the coefficients of the transfer function. Linear estimators of the time varying coefficients are proposed, followed by a truncation of the wavelet expansion up to an appropriate scale. Finally, the estimators for the transfer function coefficients are obtained by using the inverse wavelet transformation. Research results suggest that the transfer function models with variable coefficients fit the behavior of the anchovies' landing with great accuracy, while the use of transfer function models with constant coefficients fits sardines' landings better. Both fisheries' landings could be explained to a large extent from the large scale climatic variables. © 2019 by the authors.;-;English;Article

In addition, the greater number of these models have a rigid architecture which prevents the incremental learning of new classes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the Self-Improving Generative Artificial Neural Network (SIGANN), an end-to-end deep neural network system which can ease the catastrophic forgetting problem when learning new classes. In this method, we introduce a novel detection model that automatically detects samples of new classes, and an adversarial autoencoder is used to produce samples of previous classes. This system consists of three main modules: a classifier module implemented using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network, a generator module based on an adversarial autoencoder, and a novelty-detection module implemented using an OpenMax activation function. Using the EMNIST data set, the model was trained incrementally, starting with a small set of classes. The results of the simulation show that SIGANN can retain previous knowledge while incorporating gradual forgetfulness of each learning sequence at a rate of about 7% per training step. Moreover, SIGANN can detect new classes that are hidden in the data with a median accuracy of 43% and, therefore, proceed with incremental class learning. © 2019 by the authors.;Deep learning- Neural networks- Activation functions- Catastrophic forgetting problem- Convolutional neural network- Detection models- Incremental learning- Learning sequences- Neural network systems- Novelty detection- Deep neural networks;English;Article

The first method, named ""multichannel EEG thresholding by similarity"" (METS), simultaneously denoises all of the information recorded by the channels. The second approach, named ""semblance-based ERP window selection"" (SEWS), presents two versions to automatically localize the ERP in time for each subject to reduce the time window to be analysed by removing useless features. We empirically show that when these methods are used independently, they are suitable for ERP denoising and feature extraction. Meanwhile, the combination of both methods obtains better results compared to using them independently. The denoising algorithm was compared with classic thresholding methods based on wavelets and was found to obtain better results, which shows its suitability for ERP processing. The combination of the two algorithms for denoising the signals and selecting the time window has been compared to xDAWN, which is an efficient algorithm to enhance ERPs. We conclude that our wavelet-based semblance method performs better than xDAWN for single-trial detection in the presence of artifacts or noise. © 2019 Carolina Saavedra et al.";Computation theory- Computer science- Mathematical techniques- De-noising algorithm- Event-related potentials- Multichannel EEG- Similarity measure- Thresholding- Thresholding methods- Wavelet domain- Window selection- Feature extraction- algorithm- artifact- brain- computer simulation- electroencephalography- evoked response- human- physiology- procedures- signal processing- Algorithms- Artifacts- Brain- Computer Simulation- Electroencephalography- Evoked Potentials- Humans- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

The method can be applied to any signal without knowing its analytical form. In the experiments, we have compared the proposed Grünwald-Letnikov computational fractional derivative method with the Riemman-Louville fractional derivative approach for two well-known functions. The simulations exhibit similar results for both methods- however, the Grünwald-Letnikov method outperforms the other approach in execution time. Finally, we show an application of how our proposal can be useful to find the fractional relationship between two well-known biomedical signals. © 2018 Matías Salinas et al.;Circuit simulation- Engineering- Industrial engineering- Software engineering- Analytical forms- Biomedical signal- Derivative method- Digital signals- Fractional derivatives- Bioelectric phenomena;English;Article

However, such updates need to be performed at the right pace. On the one hand, if the updates are not quickly enough, the reconfigurations that are required may not be detected due to the obsolescence of the specification models used at runtime, which were specified at design-time. On the other hand, the other extreme is to promote premature reconfiguration decisions that are based on models that may be highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and which may affect the stability of these systems. To deal with the required trade-offs of this situation, this paper proposes the use of linguistic decision-making (LDM) models to represent specification models of SBSs and a dynamic computing-with-words (CWW) architecture to dynamically assess the models by using a multi-period multi-attribute decision making (MP-MADM) approach. The proposed solution allows systems under dynamic environments to offer improved system stability by better managing the trade-off between the potential obsolescence of the specification models, and the required dynamic sensitivity and update of these models. © 2018, the Authors.;Economic and social effects- Linguistics- Memory architecture- Obsolescence- Quality of service- Soft computing- Specifications- System stability- Web services- Computing with word (CWW)- Computing With Words (CWW)- Decision making models- Dynamic environments- Environmental fluctuations- Multi attribute decision making- Run time reconfiguration- Service-based systems- Decision making;English;Article

Time series, multivariate analysis and data mining techniques, along with technical literature review for results validation. The KDD approach and the data mining techniques implemented achieved an integration between these variables, identifying relevant patterns associated with fisheries abundance fluctuations and strong association with environmental changes such as El Niño and long-term cold–warm regimes between them, establishing anchovy and sardine pre-dominant time-periods, associated with environmental conditions are identified.

Derivative approaches consider using Linear Combination of Derivatives (LCD) and Fractional Derivatives (FDPα). Four informed healthy subjects, aging 35.8 ±11.0 years old, agreed to perform Handgrip maneuvers. Signals are recorded continually- a Finapres NOVA device is used for fiAP, while a BIOPAC System is used for PPG and ECG. PPG is smoothed and segmented by heartbeat- recording sections interfered with spiky blocking noise, are eliminated. Finally, PPG is processed using LCD and FDPα and their results are enriched using Lasso technique. Twenty records per subject at rest and twenty at raised BP are analyzed. Results show PPG to fiAP fitting errors 5.38% ±0.91 at resting fiAP and 5.86% ±1.21 at raised fiAP, being always lower than 15%, suggesting that derivative approaches could be suitable for medical applications.

One of the simplest solutions to this issue is adding samples of previous data, with the drawback of increasingly having to store training data- or generating patterns that evoke similar responses of the previous task. We propose a model using a Recurrent Neural Network-based image generator in order to provide a Deep Convolutional Network a limited number of samples for new training data. Simulation results shows that our proposal is able to retain previous knowledge whenever some few pseudo-samples of previously recorded patterns are generated. Despite having lower performance than giving the network samples of the real dataset, this model is more biologically plausible and might help to reduce the need of storing previously trained data on bigger-scale classification classification models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;Classification (of information)- Convolution- Deep learning- Neural networks- Neurology- Recurrent neural networks- Catastrophic forgetting- Classification models- Computational neuroscience- Connectionist models- Convolutional networks- Convolutional neural network- Incremental learning- Stability-plasticity dilemma- Deep neural networks;English;Conference Paper

Several AdaBoost approaches that use Parallel processing, in order to speed up the computation in Large datasets, have been recently proposed. These approaches try to approximate the classic AdaBoost, thus sacrificing its generalization ability. In this work, we use Concurrent Computing in order to improve the Distribution Weight estimation, hence obtaining improvements in the capacity of generalization. We train in parallel in each round several weak hypotheses, and using a weighted ensemble we update the distribution weights of the following boosting rounds. Our results show that in most cases the performance of AdaBoost is improved and that the algorithm converges rapidly.

This constructive learning algorithm attempts to identify the structure of the model based on an architectural self-organization mechanism with a data-driven approach. The proposed training algorithm self-organizes the model with intuitive adding, merging and splitting operations. Sub-networks compete to learn specific training patterns and, to accomplish this task, the algorithm can either add new neurons, merge correlated ones or split existing ones with unsatisfactory performance. The proposed algorithm does not use a clustering method to partition the input-space like most of the state of the art algorithms. The proposed approach has been tested on well-known synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our proposal is able to find the most suitable architecture with better results compared with those obtained with other methods from the literature. © 2016 the authors.;Algorithms- Clustering algorithms- Fuzzy systems- Learning algorithms- Structure (composition)- Adaptive learning algorithm- Constructive learning algorithm- Neuro-fuzzy inference systems- Neuro-Fuzzy model- Nonlinear structure- Self organizations- Self-organization mechanisms- State-of-the-art algorithms- Fuzzy inference;English;Article

The main aim of this platform is to make more efficient and transparent the contracting processes. Nowadays, tenders asking more than one good and/or service are answered separately. Thus, after receiving the offers from the sellers, the buyer must select for each part of the tender the best offer. Unfortunately, this is an inefficient and non optimal process. On the one hand, buyers spend much time in building a joint contract where not necessarily they obtained the best deal and on the other hand, small providers are less likely to be selected (if they apply) when competing with bigger providers or alliances of them (which already offer most products and typically at better prices). To address these issues, we presented VirtualMarket, a multi-agent platform, which extends the ChileCompra's platform representing providers as software agents (with willingness to cooperate), which, through the creation of alliances, are capable of naturally identifying associativity opportunities, when tenders are published, and negotiate pre-agreements which make them more competitive. In this ongoing work, we propose to use a slightly modified version of the Zeuthen Strategy in order to support providers agents during the negotiation of the terms of the alliance formation without revealing their utility functions. Our preliminary results about the feasibility and performance of our proposal are encouraging. © 2014 IEEE.;Electronic commerce- Intelligent agents- Alliance formation- Contracting process- Multi-agent platforms- negotiation- Optimal process- Utility functions- Virtual markets- Zeuthen Strategy- Multi agent systems;English;Conference Paper

However, there is no precise anatomical description of some of the processes of human fetal development. The purpose of our study is to develop a quantitative description of the normal axial skeleton by means of high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) images, collected from six normal 20-week-old human fetuses fixed in formaldehyde. Methods: Fetuses were collected after spontaneous abortion and subsequently fixed with formalin. They were imaged using a 1.5T MR scanner with an isotropic spatial resolution of 200μm. The correct tissue discrimination between ossified and cartilaginous bones was confirmed by comparing the images achieved by MR scans and computerized axial tomographies. The vertebral column was segmented out from each image using a specially developed semi-automatic algorithm. Results: Vertebral body dimensions and inter-vertebral distances were larger in the lumbar region, in agreement with the beginning of the ossification process from the thoracolumbar region toward the sacral and cephalic ends.

The objective of VQ is to statistically preserve the topological relationships existing in a data set and to project the data to a lattice of lower dimensions, for visualization, compression, storage, or transmission purposes. However, one of the major drawbacks in the application of artificial neural networks is the difficulty to properly specify the structure of the lattice that best preserves the topology of the data. To overcome this problem, in this paper we introduce merging algorithms for machine-fusion, boosting-fusion-based and hybrid-fusion ensembles of SOM, NG and GSOM networks. In these ensembles not the output signals of the base learners are combined, but their architectures are properly merged. We empirically show the quality and robustness of the topological representation of our proposed algorithm using both synthetic and real benchmarks datasets. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

But quality is uncertain, therefore, several researchers have applied Fuzzy logic to address the imprecision of the quality of service (QoS) constraints. Furthermore, the service market is highly dynamic and competitive, where web services are constantly entering and exiting this market, and they are continually improving themselves due to the competition. Current fuzzy-based techniques are expert and/or consensus-based, and therefore too fragile, expensive, non-scalable and non-self-adaptive. In this paper we introduce a new methodology to support requesters in selecting Web services by automatically connecting imprecisely defined QoS constraints with overly precise service QoS offerings over the time. We address the dynamism of the market by using each time a modified fuzzy c-means module that allows providers to automatically organize themselves around the QoS levels. The advantage of our approach is that consumers can specify their QoS constraints without really knowing what are the current best quality ranges. We illustrate our approach with a case of study. © 2011 IEEE.;Dynamic environments- Fuzzy C mean- Fuzzy modeling- Non-functional requirements- QoS constraints- Quality of Service constraints- Self-adaptive- Service markets- Service provider- Web service discovery- Commerce- Fuzzy logic- Quality of service- Web services;English;Conference Paper

The technique consists in several steps from adquisition up to the person identification. Our contribution consists in a multimodal algorithm where a fragmentation of the normalized iris image is performed and, afterwards, regional statistical descriptors with Self-Organizing- Maps are extracted. By means of a biometric fusion of the resulting descriptors, the features of the iris are compared and classified.

The new model, called robust and flexible hierarchical self-organizing maps (RoFlex-HSOM), combines the capabilities of robustness against noise and the flexibility to adapt to the changing environment. The RoFlex-HSOM model consists of a hierarchical tree structure of growing self-organizing maps (SOMs) that adapts its architecture based on the data. The model preserves the topology mapping from the high-dimensional time-dependent input space onto a neuron position in a low-dimensional hierarchical output space grid. Furthermore, the RoFlex-HSOM algorithm has the plasticity to track and adapt to the topological drift, it gradually forgets (but no catastrophically) previous learned patterns and it is resistant to the presence of noise. We empirically show the capabilities of our model with experimental results using synthetic sequential data sets and the ""El Niño"" real world data. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the extraction of biometrical parameter of tumors is of paramount importance both for clinical practice and for clinical studies that evaluate new brain tumor therapies. Tumor segmentation from brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is a difficult task due to strong signal heterogeneities and weak contrast at the boundary delimitation. In this work we propose a new framework to segment the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) from brain MRI. The proposed algorithm was constructed based on two well known techniques: Region Growing and Fuzzy C-Means. Furthermore, it considers the intricate nature of the GBM in MRI and incorporates a fuzzy formulation of Region Growing with an automatic initialization of the seed points.

However, cardiomyopathy patients are predominantly monitored using cardiac biomarkers. The aim of this study is therefore to explore aortic function in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Fourteen idiopathic DCM patients and 16 controls underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, with aortic relative pressure derived using physics-based image processing and a virtual cohort utilized to assess the impact of cardiovascular properties on aortic behaviour. Subjects with reduced left ventricular systolic function had significantly reduced aortic relative pressure, increased aortic stiffness, and significantly delayed time-to-pressure peak duration. From the virtual cohort, aortic stiffness and aortic volumetric size were identified as key determinants of aortic relative pressure. As such, this study shows how advanced flow imaging and aortic hemodynamic evaluation could provide novel insights into the manifestation of DCM, with signs of both altered aortic structure and function derived in DCM using our proposed imaging protocol.

However, it is subject to artifacts such as noise and aliasing, which due to the 3D and dynamic structure is difficult to detect in clinical practice. In this work, a new mathematical and computational model to determine the quality of 4D Flow MRI is presented. The model is derived by assuming the true velocity satisfies the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and that can be decomposed by the measurements (Formula presented.) plus an extra field (Formula presented.). Therefore, a non-linear problem with (Formula presented.) as unknown arises, which serves as a measure of data quality. A stabilized finite element formulation tailored to this problem is proposed and analyzed. Then, extensive numerical examples—using synthetic 4D Flow MRI data as well as real measurements on experimental phantom and subjects—illustrate the ability to use (Formula presented.) for assessing the quality of 4D Flow MRI measurements over space and time. © 2022 The Authors.

This work quantifies several three-dimensional hemodynamic parameters in different patients with BAV and ranks their relationships with aortic diameter. Materials and Methods: Using 4D-flow CMR data of 74 patients with BAV (49 right-left and 25 right-non-coronary) and 48 healthy volunteers, aortic 3D maps of seventeen 17 different hemodynamic parameters were quantified along the thoracic aorta. Patients with BAV were divided into two morphotype categories, BAV-Non-AAoD (where we include 18 non-dilated patients and 7 root-dilated patients) and BAV-AAoD (where we include the 49 patients with dilatation of the ascending aorta). Differences between volunteers and patients were evaluated using MANOVA with Pillai's trace statistic, Mann–Whitney U test, ROC curves, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm. Spearman's correlation was used to correlate the dilation with each hemodynamic parameter. Results: The flow eccentricity, backward velocity, velocity angle, regurgitation fraction, circumferential wall shear stress, axial vorticity, and axial circulation allowed to discriminate between volunteers and patients with BAV, even in the absence of dilation. In patients with BAV, the diameter presented a strong correlation (> |+/−0.7|) with the forward velocity and velocity angle, and a good correlation (> |+/−0.5|) with regurgitation fraction, wall shear stress, wall shear stress axial, and vorticity, also for morphotypes and phenotypes, some of them are correlated with the diameter. The velocity angle proved to be an excellent biomarker in the differentiation between volunteers and patients with BAV, BAV morphotypes, and BAV phenotypes, with an area under the curve bigger than 0.90, and higher predictor important scores. Conclusions: Through the application of a novel 3D quantification method, hemodynamic parameters related to flow direction, such as flow eccentricity, velocity angle, and regurgitation fraction, presented the best relationships with a local diameter and effectively differentiated patients with BAV from healthy volunteers.

Therefore, there is a need for new hemodynamic biomarkers to refine disease monitoring and improve patient risk stratification. This research aims to analyze and extract multiple correlation patterns of hemodynamic parameters from 4D Flow MRI data and find which parameters allow an accurate classification between healthy volunteers (HV) and BAV patients with dilated and non-dilated ascending aorta using machine learning. Sixteen hemodynamic parameters were calculated in the ascending aorta (AAo) and aortic arch (AArch) at peak systole from 4D Flow MRI. We used sequential forward selection (SFS) and principal component analysis (PCA) as feature selection algorithms. Then, eleven machine-learning classifiers were implemented to separate HV and BAV patients (non- and dilated ascending aorta). Multiple correlation patterns from hemodynamic parameters were extracted using hierarchical clustering. The linear discriminant analysis and random forest are the best performing classifiers, using five hemodynamic parameters selected with SFS (velocity angle, forward velocity, vorticity, and backward velocity in AAo- and helicity density in AArch) a 96.31 ± 1.76% and 96.00 ± 0.83% accuracy, respectively. Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of correlated features. According to this analysis, we observed that features selected by SFS have a better performance than those selected by PCA because the five selected parameters were distributed according to 3 different clusters. Based on the proposed method, we concluded that the feature selection method found five potentially hemodynamic biomarkers related to this disease. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Blood vessels- Decision trees- Discriminant analysis- Feature extraction- Hemodynamics- Machine learning- Medical imaging- Principal component analysis- Bicuspid aortic valves- Correlation patterns- Features selection- Haemodynamics- Healthy volunteers- Hemodynamic biomarker- Hemodynamic parameters- Multiple correlation- Principal-component analysis- Sequential forward selection- Biomarkers- biological marker- biological marker- adult- aortic arch- aortic diameter- aortic root- artery dilatation- ascending aorta- bicuspid aortic valve- cardiovascular magnetic resonance- classifier- clinical feature- controlled study- cross validation- demography- diagnostic accuracy- disease classification- feature selection algorithm- female- four-dimensional imaging- heart contraction- hemodynamic parameters- hemodynamics- hierarchical clustering- human- Letter- machine learning- major clinical study- male- measurement accuracy- middle aged- morphotype- random forest- sensitivity and specificity- systole- velocity- aortic valve- diagnostic imaging- dilatation- hemodynamics- machine learning- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- procedures- valvular heart disease- Aortic Valve- Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease- Biomarkers- Dilatation- Heart Valve Diseases- Hemodynamics- Humans- Machine Learning- Magnetic Resonance Imaging;English;Letter

Libertador Bernando O'Higgins 340Santiago 833-1150, Chile;AIMS: In this study, we will describe a comprehensive haemodynamic analysis and its relationship to the dilation of the aorta in transposition of the great artery (TGA) patients post-arterial switch operation (ASO) and controls using 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using 4D-flow MRI data of 14 TGA young patients and 8 age-matched normal controls obtained with 1.5 T GE-MR scanner, we evaluate 3D maps of 15 different haemodynamics parameters in six regions- three of them in the aortic root and three of them in the ascending aorta (anterior-left, -right, and posterior for both cases) to find its relationship with the aortic arch curvature and root dilation. Differences between controls and patients were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test, and the relationship with the curvature was accessed by unpaired t-test. For statistical significance, we consider a P-value of 0.05. The aortic arch curvature was significantly different between patients 46.238 ± 5.581 m-1 and controls 41.066 ± 5.323 m-1. Haemodynamic parameters as wall shear stress circumferential (WSS-C), and eccentricity (ECC), were significantly different between TGA patients and controls in both the root and ascending aorta regions. The distribution of forces along the ascending aorta is highly inhomogeneous in TGA patients. We found that the backward velocity (B-VEL), WSS-C, velocity angle (VEL-A), regurgitation fraction (RF), and ECC are highly correlated with the aortic arch curvature and root dilatation. CONCLUSION: We have identified six potential biomarkers (B-VEL, WSS-C, VEL-A, RF, and ECC), which may be helpful for follow-up evaluation and early prediction of aortic root dilatation in this patient population.

Libertador Bernando O’Higgins, Santiago, 340, Chile;Abnormal deformation of blood vessels has been related to the onset and progression of prevalent cardiovascular diseases. This mechanical connection has motivated the development of computational techniques to assess strain fields in the wall of the aorta from medical images. In this work, we present the mechanics-informed snakes isogeometric analysis (MISIGA) method, which provides seamless 3D estimations of strain fields in the full aorta from magnetic resonance images. Our approach leverages image segmentation formulations with advanced curvilinear representations of irregular vessels to capture the deformation mapping between two configurations captured by image datasets. We further inform this model by describing the motion of the aortic wall based on a Kirchhoff-Love shell approach, which allows us to construct continuous circumferential and longitudinal strain fields in the full aorta. We validate the MISIGA method using synthetically generated images from aortic mechanical simulations, obtaining errors in the strain estimation of 13.2 and 9.8 for the circumferential and longitudinal components. This performance compares favorably with other approaches that are not informed by mechanical considerations. Further, we apply the MISIGA method in the strain assessment of the aorta of a normal subject, which results in longitudinal and circumferential strain values that are in the range of those found in previous studies. We envision that the MISIGA method can open the way to seamless 3D high-fidelity analysis of local strain from medical images of the aorta and other vessels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;Blood- Blood vessels- Deformation- Image analysis- Image segmentation- Magnetic resonance- Magnetic resonance imaging- Medical imaging- Active contours- Active-contour fitting- Analysis method- Aorta- Circumferential strain- Contour fittings- Isogeometric analysis- Kirchhoff-love shells- Local strains- Strain fields- Strain;English;Article

Due to the complex interplay between blood flow and the artery wall, PWV is related to inherent mechanical properties and arterial morphology. PWV has been widely accepted as a biomarker and early predictor to evaluate global arterial distensibility. Still, several local abnormalities often remain hidden or difficult to detect using non-invasive techniques. Here, we introduce a novel method to efficiently construct a local estimate of PWV along the aorta using 4D-Flow MRI data. A geodesic distance map was used to track advancing pulses for efficient flow calculations, based on the observation that the propagation of velocity wavefronts strongly depends on the arterial morphology. This procedure allows us a robust evaluation of the local transit time due to the pulse wave at each position in the aorta. Moreover, the estimation of the local PWV map did not require centerlines, and the final result is projected back to 3D using the same geodesic map. We evaluated PWV values in healthy young and adult volunteers and patients with univentricular physiology after a Fontan procedure. Our method is fast, semi-automatic, and depicts differences between young versus adult volunteers and young volunteers versus Fontan patients, showing consistent results compared to global methods. Remarkably, the technique could detect local differences of PWV on the aortic arch for all subjects, being consistent with previous findings of reduced PWV in the aortic arch. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Arches- Blood vessels- Geodesy- Morphology- Wave propagation- 4d-flow MRI- Aortic arch- Arterial distensibility- Arterial stiffness- Arterial tree- Blood flow- Cardiac disease- Pressure waves- Pulse-wave velocity- Wall pulse- Acoustic wave velocity- adolescent- adult- aortic arch- arterial stiffness- Article- clinical article- controlled study- Fontan procedure- four-dimensional imaging- human- morphology- non invasive procedure- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- pulse wave velocity;English;Article

Methods: We validate our 3D method using an in-silico arch model, for different mesh resolutions, image resolution and noise levels, and we compared this with a currently used 2D method. Finally, we evaluated the application of our methodology in 4D Flow MRI data of ascending aorta of six healthy volunteers, and six bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients, three with right and three with left handed flow, at peak systole. The in-vivo data was compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test between volunteers and patients (right and left handed flow). Results: The robustness of our method throughout different image resolutions and noise levels showed subestimation of circulation less than 45 cm2/s in comparison with the 55cm2/s generated by the current 2D method. The circulation (mean ± SD) of the healthy volunteer group was 13.83 ± 28.78 cm2/s, in BAV patients with right-handed flow 724.37 ± 317.53 cm2/s, and BAV patients with left-handed flow −480.99 ± 387.29 cm2/s. There were significant differences between healthy volunteers and BAV patients groups (P-value &lt-.01), and also between BAV patients with a right-handed or left-handed helical flow and healthy volunteers (P-value &lt-.01). Conclusion: We propose a novel 3D formulation to estimate the circulation in the thoracic aorta, which can be used to assess the differences between normal and diseased hemodynamic from 4D-Flow MRI data. This method also can correctly differentiate between the visually seen right- and left-handed helical flow, which suggests that this approach may have high clinical sensitivity, but requires confirmation in longitudinal studies with a large cohort. © 2021 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine;Blood vessels- Image resolution- Bicuspid aortic valves- Healthy volunteers- Helical flows- Longitudinal study- Mann-Whitney U test- Mesh resolution- Thoracic aorta- Threedimensional (3-d)- Finite element method- Article- bicuspid aortic valve- computer model- controlled study- feasibility study- finite element analysis- four-dimensional imaging- hemodynamics- human- image analysis- image quality- in vivo study- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- sensitivity analysis- systole- thoracic aorta- two-dimensional imaging- validation study- aorta- aortic valve- blood flow velocity- diagnostic imaging- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- three-dimensional imaging- valvular heart disease- Aorta- Aorta, Thoracic- Aortic Valve- Blood Flow Velocity- Heart Valve Diseases- Hemodynamics- Humans- Imaging, Three-Dimensional- Magnetic Resonance Imaging;English;Article

Specifically, tissue engineering vascular grafts (TEVG) have the potential to replace biological and synthetic grafts. We aimed to design an in-vitro patient-specific patch based on a hybrid 3D print combined with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) differentiation. Based on the medical images of a 2 months-old girl with aortic arch hypoplasia and using computational modelling, we evaluated the most hemodynamically efficient aortic patch surgical repair. Using the designed 3D patch geometry, the scaffold was printed using a hybrid fused deposition modelling (FDM) and electrospinning techniques. The scaffold was seeded with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for later maturation to derived VSMC (dVSMC). The graft showed adequate resistance to physiological aortic pressure (burst pressure 101 ​± ​15 ​mmHg) and a porosity gradient ranging from 80 to 10 ​μm allowing cells to infiltrate through the entire thickness of the patch. The bio-scaffolds showed good cell viability at days 4 and 12 and adequate functional vasoactive response to endothelin-1. In summary, we have shown that our method of generating patient-specific patch shows adequate hemodynamic profile, mechanical properties, dVSMC infiltration, viability and functionality. This innovative 3D biotechnology has the potential for broad application in regenerative medicine and potentially in heart disease prevention. © 2022 The Authors;3D printers- Biomechanics- Blood vessels- Cell engineering- Electrospinning- Grafts- Medical imaging- Muscle- Scaffolds (biology)- Stem cells- 3-D printing- 3D-printing- Cardiovascular tissues- Damaged structures- In-vitro- Mesenchymal stem cell- Patient specific- Tissues engineerings- Vascular grafts- Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells- Cell culture;English;Article

Medical Center Drive, Cardiovascular Center 5588, SPC-5030, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5030, United States;Background: Chronic type B aortic dissection (TBAD) is associated with poor long-term outcome, and accurate risk stratification tools remain lacking. Pressurization of the false lumen (FL) has been recognized as central in promoting aortic growth. Several surrogate imaging-based metrics have been proposed to assess FL hemodynamics- however, their relationship to enlarging aortic dimensions remains unclear. We investigated the association between aortic growth and three cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived metrics of FL pressurization: false lumen ejection fraction (FLEF), maximum systolic deceleration rate (MSDR), and FL relative pressure (FL ΔPmax). Methods: CMR/CMR angiography was performed in 12 patients with chronic dissection of the descending thoracoabdominal aorta, including contrast-enhanced CMR angiography and time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast CMR (4D Flow CMR). Aortic growth rate was calculated as the change in maximal aortic diameter between baseline and follow-up imaging studies over the time interval, with patients categorized as having either ‘stable’ (&lt- 3 mm/year) or ‘enlarging’ (≥ 3 mm/year) growth. Three metrics relating to FL pressurization were defined as: (1) FLEF: the ratio between retrograde and antegrade flow at the TBAD entry tear, (2) MSDR: the absolute difference between maximum and minimum systolic acceleration in the proximal FL, and (3) FL ΔPmax: the difference in absolute pressure between aortic root and distal FL. Results: FLEF was higher in enlarging TBAD (49.0 ± 17.9% vs. 10.0 ± 11.9%, p = 0.002), whereas FL ΔPmax was lower (32.2 ± 10.8 vs. 57.2 ± 12.5 mmHg/m, p = 0.017). MSDR and conventional anatomic variables did not differ significantly between groups. FLEF showed positive (r = 0.78, p = 0.003) correlation with aortic growth rate whereas FL ΔPmax showed negative correlation (r = − 0.64, p = 0.026). FLEF and FL ΔPmax remained as independent predictors of aortic growth rate after adjusting for baseline aortic diameter. Conclusion: Comparative analysis of three 4D flow CMR metrics of TBAD FL pressurization demonstrated that those that focusing on retrograde flow (FLEF) and relative pressure (FL ΔPmax) independently correlated with growth and differentiated patients with enlarging and stable descending aortic dissections. These results emphasize the highly variable nature of aortic hemodynamics in TBAD patients, and suggest that 4D Flow CMR derived metrics of FL pressurization may be useful to separate patients at highest and lowest risk for progressive aortic growth and complications. © 2021, The Author(s).;beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent- ferumoxytol- gadobenate dimeglumine- abdominal aorta- adult- aged- aortic diameter- aortic dissection- aortic pressure- aortic root- Article- cardiac patient- cardiovascular magnetic resonance- cardiovascular parameters- chronic disease- clinical article- comparative study- contrast enhancement- controlled study- correlational study- deceleration- descending aorta- false lumen ejection fraction- false lumen relative pressure- female- follow up- four-dimensional imaging- growth rate- heart hemodynamics- human- low risk patient- magnetic resonance angiography- male- maximum systolic deceleration rate- prediction- prospective study- systolic blood pressure- thoracic aorta- three-dimensional imaging- aorta- diagnostic imaging- dissecting aneurysm- hemodynamics- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy- predictive value- thoracic aorta aneurysm- treatment outcome- Aneurysm, Dissecting- Aorta- Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic- Hemodynamics- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy- Predictive Value of Tests- Treatment Outcome;English;Article

The harmonic phase of the images is unwrapped and treated as noisy measurements of reference coordinates on a deformed domain, obtaining motion with high accuracy using Radial Basis Functions interpolations. Results were compared against Shortest Path HARP Refinement (SP-HR) and Sine-wave Modeling (SinMod), two harmonic image-based techniques for motion estimation from tagged images. HARP-I showed a favorable similarity with both methods under noise-free conditions, whereas a more robust performance was found in the presence of noise. Cardiac strain was better estimated using HARP-I at almost any motion level, giving strain maps with less artifacts. Additionally, HARP-I showed better temporal consistency as a new method was developed to fix phase jumps between frames. In conclusion, HARP-I showed to be a robust method for the estimation of motion and strain under ideal and non-ideal conditions. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Harmonic analysis- Interpolation- Magnetic resonance imaging- Harmonic images- Noisy measurements- Non-ideal conditions- Phase interpolation- Radial basis functions- Reference coordinates- Robust performance- Temporal consistency- Motion estimation- article- artifact- cardiovascular magnetic resonance- heart- motion- noise- algorithm- image processing- motion- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- carrier protein- cytokine- pleiotrophin- Algorithms- Carrier Proteins- Cytokines- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Motion;English;Article

In this work we provide a validation and comparison with phantom and clinical patient data of pressure difference maps estimators. We compare the classical Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE) and the new Stokes Estimator (STE) against catheter pressure measurements under a variety of stenosis severities and flow intensities. Specifically, we use several 4D Flow data sets of realistic aortic phantoms with different anatomic and hemodynamic severities and two patients with aortic coarctation. The phantom data sets are enriched by subsampling to lower resolutions, modification of the segmentation and addition of synthetic noise, in order to study the sensitivity of the pressure difference estimators to these factors. Overall, the STE method yields more accurate results than the PPE method compared to catheterization data. The superiority of the STE becomes more evident at increasing Reynolds numbers with a better capacity of capturing pressure gradients in strongly convective flow regimes. The results indicate an improved robustness of the STE method with respect to variation in lumen segmentation. However, with heuristic removal of the wall-voxels, the PPE can reach a comparable accuracy for lower Reynolds’ numbers. © 2021 The Author(s);Diagnosis- Hospital data processing- Navier Stokes equations- Phantoms- Reynolds number- Aortic coarctation- Convective flow- Lower resolution- Lumen segmentations- Pressure differences- Spatially resolved- Stokes equations- Synthetic noise- Blood vessels- adult- aortic coarctation- aortic flow- Article- case report- catheterization- clinical article- female- flow measurement- four-dimensional imaging- hemodynamic parameters- human- image analysis- male- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- patient coding- pressure gradient- pressure measurement- aortic coarctation- blood flow velocity- hemodynamics- imaging phantom- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- reproducibility- Aortic Coarctation- Blood Flow Velocity- Hemodynamics- Humans- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Phantoms, Imaging- Reproducibility of Results;English;Article

Here, we described the effect of instantaneous spatial representation (sEMG segmentation) on embedded fuzzy topological polyhedrons and image features extracted from sEMG activation maps. We analyzed 73,008 topographic sEMG activation maps from seven healthy participants (age 21.4 ± 1.5 years and body mass 74.5 ± 8.5 kg) who performed submaximal isometric plantar flexions with 64 surface electrodes placed over the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Window lengths of 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, and 1,000 ms and overlap of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90% to change sEMG map generation were tested in a factorial design (grid search). The Shannon entropy and volume of global embedded tri-dimensional geometries (polyhedron projections), and the Shannon entropy, location of the center (LoC), and image moments of maps were analyzed. The polyhedron volume increased when the overlap was <25% and >75%. Entropy decreased when the overlap was <25% and >75% and when the window length was <100 ms and >500 ms. The LoC in the x-axis, entropy, and the histogram moments of maps showed effects for overlap (p < 0.001), while the LoC in the y-axis and entropy showed effects for both overlap and window length (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the instantaneous sEMG maps are first affected by outer parameters of the overlap, followed by the length of the window. Thus, choosing the window length and overlap parameters can introduce bias in sEMG activation maps, resulting in distorted regional muscle activation.

Brasil 2950, Valparaíso, Chile;Medical images segmentation has become a fundamental tool for making more precise the assessment of complex diagnosis and surgical tasks. In particular, this work focuses on multiple sclerosis (MS) disease in which lesion segmentation is useful for getting an accurate diagnosis and for tracking its progression. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully employed for segmenting MS lesions. However, these methods often fail in defining the boundaries of the MS lesions accurately. This work focuses on segmenting hard-to-classify voxels close to MS lesions boundaries in MRI, where it was determined that the application of a loss function that focuses the penalty on difficult voxels generates an increase in the results with respect to the Dice similarity metric (DSC), where the latter occurs as long as the sufficient representation of these voxels as well as an adequate preprocessing of the images of each patient. The methodology was tested in the public data set ISBI2015 and was compared with alternative methods that are trained using the binary cross entropy loss function and the focal loss function with uniform and stratified sampling, obtaining better results in DSC, reaching a DSC&gt- 0.7, a threshold that is considered comparable to that obtained by another human expert. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Convolution- Convolutional neural networks- Diagnosis- Image segmentation- Medical imaging- Boundary voxels- Brain lesions- Convolutional neural network- Lesion segmentations- Loss functions- Medical image segmentation- Multiple sclerosis- Multiple sclerosis lesions- Penalisation- Similarity metrics- Magnetic resonance imaging;English;Conference Paper

It has been shown to be advantageous for the ambulatory monitoring of vocal function, specifically in the use of high-order statistics to understand long-term vocal behavior. However, during long-term ambulatory recordings over several days, conditions may drift from the laboratory environment where the IBIF parameters were initially estimated due to sensor positioning, skin attachment, or temperature, among other factors. Observation uncertainties and model mismatch may result in significant deviations in the glottal airflow estimates- unfortunately, they are very difficult to quantify in ambulatory conditions due to a lack of a reference signal. To address this issue, we propose a Kalman filter implementation of the IBIF filter, which allows for both estimating the model uncertainty and adapting the airflow estimates to correct for signal deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) results from laboratory experiments using the Rainbow Passage indicate an improvement using the modified Kalman filter on amplitude-based measures for phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH) subjects compared to the standard IBIF- the latter showing a statistically difference (p-value = 0.02, F = 4.1) with respect to a reference glottal volume velocity signal estimated from a single notch filter used here as ground-truth in this work. In contrast, maximum flow declination rates from subjects with vocal phonotrauma exhibit a small but statistically difference between the ground-truth signal and the modified Kalman filter when using one-way ANOVA (p-value = 0.04, F = 3.3). Other measures did not have significant differences with either the modified Kalman filter or IBIF compared to ground-truth, with the exception of H1-H2, whose performance deteriorates for both methods. Overall, both methods (modified Kalman filter and IBIF) show similar glottal airflow measures, with the advantage of the modified Kalman filter to improve amplitude estimation. Moreover, Kalman filter deviations from the IBIF output airflow might suggest a better representation of some fine details in the ground-truth glottal airflow signal. Other applications may take more advantage from the adaptation offered by the modified Kalman filter implementation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;-;English;Article

However, few studies have evaluated temporal changes in the electromyographic activity (EMG) of lower limb muscles during running. The aim of this study was to compare temporal changes in EMG amplitude between RF and FF running techniques. Eleven recreational runners ran on a treadmill at a self-selected speed, once using a RF strike pattern and once using a FF strike pattern (randomized order). The EMG of five lower limb muscles [rectus femoris (RFe), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), medial and lateral gastrocnemius (MG and LG)] was evaluated, using bipolar electrodes. EMG data from the RF and FF running techniques was then processed and compared with statistical parametric mapping (SPM), dividing the analysis of the running cycle into stance and swing phases. The MG and LG muscles showed higher activation during FF running at the beginning of the stance phase and at the end of the swing phase. During the end of the swing phase, the TA muscle's EMG amplitude was higher, when the RF running technique was used. A higher level of co-activation between the gastrocnemius and TA muscles was observed in both stance and swing phases using RF. The myoelectric behaviour of the RFe and BF muscles was similar during both running techniques. The current findings highlight that the two running techniques predominately reflect adjustments of the shank and not the thigh muscles, in both phases of the running cycle. Highlights Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) can reveal temporal differences in muscle activity between running techniques. The medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were more active at specific time-instants of the initial stance and late swing phases during forefoot (FF) running compared to rearfoot (RF) running. Higher activation was observed for the tibialis anterior muscle at the end of the swing phase during RF running Contrary to the muscle activity differences observed in the leg muscles, the muscle activity of the thigh muscles was similar during RF and FF running. © 2022 European College of Sport Science.;-;English;Article

Falls are an increasing, but not inevitable, threat to older adults. Information technologies provide several solutions to address falls, but smart homes and the most available solutions require expensive and invasive infrastructures. In this study, we propose a novel approach to classify and detect falls of older adults in their homes through low-resolution infrared sensors that are affordable, non-intrusive, do not disturb privacy, and are more acceptable to older adults. Using data collected between 2019 and 2020 with the eHomeseniors platform, we determine activity scores of older adults moving across two rooms in a house and represent an older adult fall through skeletonization. We find that our twofold approach effectively detects activity patterns and precisely identifies falls. Our study provides insights to physicians about the daily activities of their older adults and could potentially help them make decisions in case of abnormal behavior. © 2022 by the authors.

The classic fMRI analysis pipeline is based on the assumption that the hemodynamic response (HR) is the same across brain regions, time, and subjects. Although convenient, there is ample evidence that this assumption does not hold, and that these differences result in inaccuracies in brain activity detection. This article presents a new fMRI processing pipeline that captures the intrinsic intra-and intersubject variability of the HR. At the core of this new pipeline is the definition of a fuzzy hemodynamic response function (HRF). The proposed pipeline includes a new fuzzy general linear model (GLM) able to handle the fuzzy HRF, including a practical realization based on the LR representation of fuzzy numbers. This article also describes how to obtain activation maps from the fuzzy GLM, and a methodology to compute the statistical power of the analysis. The method is evaluated in synthetic and real fMRI data and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments based on synthetic data show that the fuzzy GLM approach is more robust under uncertainty regarding the true specific shape of the HR. The experiments based on the real data show an increased volume of the activated brain areas, suggesting that the proposed method is able to prevent false negative errors in the boundaries of target brain regions in which HR should be negligible. © 1993-2012 IEEE.;Activation analysis- Brain- Fuzzy rules- Hemodynamics- Magnetic resonance imaging- Magnetism- Pipelines- Resonance- False negative errors- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- Fuzzy numbers- General linear modeling- Hemodynamic response- Hemodynamic response functions- Neuroimaging techniques- State-of-the-art techniques- Functional neuroimaging;English;Article

Nevertheless, there is no clear reference protocol for its implementation- one of the questions being which b-value distribution to use. This study aimed to stress the importance of the sampling scheme and to show that an optimized b-value distribution decreases the variance associated with IVIM parameters in the brain with respect to a regular distribution in healthy volunteers. Methods: Ten volunteers were included in this study- images were acquired on a 1.5T MR scanner. Two distributions of 16 b-values were used: one considered ‘regular’ due to its close association with that used in other studies, and the other considered ‘optimized’ according to previous studies. IVIM parameters were adjusted according to the bi-exponential model, using two-step method. Analysis was undertaken in ROI defined using in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas, and parameters distributions were compared in a total of 832 ROI. Results: Maps with fewer speckles were obtained with the ‘optimized’ distribution. Coefficients of varia-tion did not change significantly for the estimation of the diffusion coefficient D but decreased by approx-imately 39% for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient estimation and by 21% for the perfusion fraction. Distributions of adjusted parameters were found significantly different in 50% of the cases for the perfusion fraction, in 80% of the cases for the pseudo-diffusion coefficient and 17% of the cases for the diffusion coefficient. Observations across brain areas show that the range of average values for IVIM parameters is smaller in the ‘optimized’ case. Conclusion: Using an optimized distribution, data are sampled in a way that the IVIM signal decay is better described and less variance is obtained in the fitted parameters. The increased precision gained could help to detect small variations in IVIM parameters. © 2019 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.;brain- diagnostic imaging- diffusion weighted imaging- human- image processing- movement (physiology)- physiology- procedures- Brain- Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Movement;English;Article

As many data analysis algorithms are not designed to work with missing data, a frequent approach is to remove all variables associated with such records from the analysis. A much better alternative is to employ data imputation techniques to estimate the missing values using statistical relationships among the variables. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a classic method to deal with missing data, but is not designed to work in typical Machine Learning settings that have training set and testing set. In this work we present an extension of the EM algorithm that can deal with this problem. We test the algorithm with ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) data set, where about 80% of the sample has missing values. Our extension of EM achieved higher accuracy and robustness in the classification performance. It was evaluated using three different classifiers and showed a significant improvement with regard to similar approaches proposed in the literature. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;Classification (of information)- Machine learning- Maximum principle- Neuroimaging- Pattern recognition- Statistical tests- ADNI- Classification performance- Data analysis algorithms- Data imputation- Expectation-maximization algorithms- Imputation- Missing data- Statistical relationship- Data mining;English;Conference Paper

The first step of brain network analysis in fMRI is to detect regions of interest (ROIs). The signals from these ROIs are then used to evaluate neural networks and quantify neuronal dynamics. The two main methods to identify ROIs are based on brain atlas registration and clustering. This work proposes a bioinspired method that combines both paradigms. The method, dubbed HAnt, consists of an anatomical clustering of the signal followed by an ant clustering step. The method is evaluated empirically in both in silico and in vivo experiments. The results show a significantly better performance of the proposed approach compared to other brain parcellations obtained using purely clustering-based strategies or atlas-based parcellations. © 2019 Alejandro Veloz et al.;Ant colony optimization- Magnetic resonance imaging- Ant clustering- Ant colony clustering- Bio-inspired methods- Brain networks- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- In-vivo experiments- Neuronal dynamics- Regions of interest- Functional neuroimaging- adult- algorithm- book- brain- brain mapping- cluster analysis- computer simulation- diagnostic imaging- female- hearing- human- image processing- male- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- physiology- procedures- young adult- Adult- Algorithms- Atlases as Topic- Auditory Perception- Brain- Brain Mapping- Cluster Analysis- Computer Simulation- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male- Young Adult;English;Article

Currently, several studies recognize that physical activity (PA) benefits brain health in children. However, most of these studies have not been carried out in developing countries or lack the transference into the education field. The Cogni-Action Project is divided into two stages, a cross-sectional study and a crossover-randomized trial. The aim of the first part is to establish the associations of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness with brain structure and function, cognitive performance and academic achievement in Chilean schoolchildren (10-13 years-old). The aim of the second part is to determinate the acute effects of three PA protocols on neuroelectric indices during a working memory and a reading task. Methods: PA and sedentarism will be self-reported and objectively-assessed with accelerometers in a representative subsample, whilst physical fitness will be evaluated through the ALPHA fitness test battery. Brain structure and function will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a randomized subsample. Cognitive performance will be assessed through the NeuroCognitive Performance Test, and academic achievement by school grades. In the second part 32 adolescents (12-13 year-old) will be cross-over randomized to these condition (i) ""Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training"" (MICT), (ii) ""Cooperative High-Intensity Interval Training"" (C-HIIT), and (iii) Sedentary condition. Neuroelectric indices will be measures by electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking, working memory by n-back task and reading comprehension by a reading task. Discussion: The main strength of this project is that, to our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the potential association of PA, sedentarism, and physical fitness on brain structure and function, cognitive performance, and academic achievement in a developing country, which presents an important sociocultural gap. For this purpose, this project will use advanced technologies in neuroimaging (MRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and eye-tracking, as well as objective and quality measurements of several physical and cognitive health outcomes.

Derivative approaches consider using Linear Combination of Derivatives (LCD) and Fractional Derivatives (FDPα). Four informed healthy subjects, aging 35.8 ±11.0 years old, agreed to perform Handgrip maneuvers. Signals are recorded continually- a Finapres NOVA device is used for fiAP, while a BIOPAC System is used for PPG and ECG. PPG is smoothed and segmented by heartbeat- recording sections interfered with spiky blocking noise, are eliminated. Finally, PPG is processed using LCD and FDPα and their results are enriched using Lasso technique. Twenty records per subject at rest and twenty at raised BP are analyzed. Results show PPG to fiAP fitting errors 5.38% ±0.91 at resting fiAP and 5.86% ±1.21 at raised fiAP, being always lower than 15%, suggesting that derivative approaches could be suitable for medical applications.

This constructive learning algorithm attempts to identify the structure of the model based on an architectural self-organization mechanism with a data-driven approach. The proposed training algorithm self-organizes the model with intuitive adding, merging and splitting operations. Sub-networks compete to learn specific training patterns and, to accomplish this task, the algorithm can either add new neurons, merge correlated ones or split existing ones with unsatisfactory performance. The proposed algorithm does not use a clustering method to partition the input-space like most of the state of the art algorithms. The proposed approach has been tested on well-known synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our proposal is able to find the most suitable architecture with better results compared with those obtained with other methods from the literature. © 2016 the authors.;Algorithms- Clustering algorithms- Fuzzy systems- Learning algorithms- Structure (composition)- Adaptive learning algorithm- Constructive learning algorithm- Neuro-fuzzy inference systems- Neuro-Fuzzy model- Nonlinear structure- Self organizations- Self-organization mechanisms- State-of-the-art algorithms- Fuzzy inference;English;Article

They can also be used in systems where maintenance is difficult or inaccessible, because they dońt require auxiliary lubrication systems and dońt suffer mechanic wear as they work with no contact between rotor and bearing stator. An important part of magnetic bearings is the controller- which is needed to stabilize the system. This controller is generally a PID in which tuning and/or filters design can be complicated for not well known systems. This work presents results of the development of a neural network controller, which is potentially easier to implement, to control the position of a magnetically suspended rotor. The proposed controller is based in the identification of the system inverse model. This is achieved first by implementing a simple PID capable of levitating the rotor, and then some excitations are applied to the rotor in order to acquire data of the position of the rotor and current in the actuators. Current and position data is used to train the artificial neural network for the controller. The controller was implemented in a numerical model and also in an experimental system with a rotor of 1.06kg and 300mm in length. The implementation of SISO, MISO and MIMO neural controllers (both with offline and online training) and a conventional PID with neural network compensation are compared. Structures and architectures of networks are shown. Vibration responses to: A constant force- a controlled impact and a constant acceleration ramp between 0 and 12500rpm are compared. Results in both, numeric model and experimental system, show that neural network controllers are capable of hovering the rotor and control vibrations. Peak-Peak amplitudes vs. rpm plots are similar to a conventional PID. In most cases, the neural network controllers show amplitudes slightly lowers on low frequencies and slightly higher on higher frequencies, except the conventional PID with neural network compensation case, were the system responses as with higher damping. Finally, a discussion is made about future steps in research to improve implementation of a neural controller that is potentially simpler and faster in terms of tuning and with a comparable performance to a conventional magnetic bearing PID controller.

Tumor segmentation from brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is a difficult task due to strong signal heterogeneities and weak contrast at the boundary delimitation. In this work we propose a new framework to segment the Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) from brain MRI. The proposed algorithm was constructed based on two well known techniques: Region Growing and Fuzzy C-Means. Furthermore, it considers the intricate nature of the GBM in MRI and incorporates a fuzzy formulation of Region Growing with an automatic initialization of the seed points.

However, the choice of STFT parameters may affect the estimation of myoelectrical manifestations of fatigue. Here, we determine the effect of window length and overlap selections on the frequency slope and the coefficient of variation from EMG spectrum features in fatiguing contractions. We also determine whether STFT parameters affect the relationship between frequency slopes and task failure. Eighty-eight healthy adult men performed one-leg heel-rise until exhaustion. A factorial design with a window length of 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ms with 0, 25, 50, 75, and 90% of overlap was used. The frequency slope was non-linearly fitted as a task failure function, followed by a dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. The STFT parameters elicited five patterns. A small window length produced a higher slope frequency for the peak frequency (p < 0.001). The contrary was found for the mean and median frequency (p < 0.001). A larger window length elicited a higher slope frequency for the mean and peak frequencies. The largest frequency slope and dispersion was found for a window length of 50 ms without overlap using peak frequency. A combination of 250 ms with 50% of overlap reduced the dispersion both for peak, median, and mean frequency, but decreased the slope frequency. Therefore, the selection of STFT parameters during dynamic contractions should be accompanied by a mechanical measure of the task failure, and its parameters should be adjusted according to the experiment's requirements. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Dispersions- Dynamics- Electromyography- Fatigue of materials- Reduction- Fourier- Gastrocnemius mediali- High slopes- Mean frequency- Median frequency- Method- Muscle activation- Peak frequencies- Short time Fourier transforms- Task failures- Muscle- adult- cluster analysis- electromyography- Fourier analysis- human- male- muscle contraction- muscle fatigue- muscle isometric contraction- skeletal muscle- Adult- Cluster Analysis- Electromyography- Fourier Analysis- Humans- Isometric Contraction- Male- Muscle Contraction- Muscle Fatigue- Muscle, Skeletal;English;Article

The classic fMRI analysis pipeline is based on the assumption that the hemodynamic response (HR) is the same across brain regions, time, and subjects. Although convenient, there is ample evidence that this assumption does not hold, and that these differences result in inaccuracies in brain activity detection. This article presents a new fMRI processing pipeline that captures the intrinsic intra-and intersubject variability of the HR. At the core of this new pipeline is the definition of a fuzzy hemodynamic response function (HRF). The proposed pipeline includes a new fuzzy general linear model (GLM) able to handle the fuzzy HRF, including a practical realization based on the LR representation of fuzzy numbers. This article also describes how to obtain activation maps from the fuzzy GLM, and a methodology to compute the statistical power of the analysis. The method is evaluated in synthetic and real fMRI data and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experiments based on synthetic data show that the fuzzy GLM approach is more robust under uncertainty regarding the true specific shape of the HR. The experiments based on the real data show an increased volume of the activated brain areas, suggesting that the proposed method is able to prevent false negative errors in the boundaries of target brain regions in which HR should be negligible. © 1993-2012 IEEE.;Activation analysis- Brain- Fuzzy rules- Hemodynamics- Magnetic resonance imaging- Magnetism- Pipelines- Resonance- False negative errors- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- Fuzzy numbers- General linear modeling- Hemodynamic response- Hemodynamic response functions- Neuroimaging techniques- State-of-the-art techniques- Functional neuroimaging;English;Article

Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants’ individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity. © Copyright © 2020 Otero, Prado-Gutiérrez, Weinstein, Escobar and El-Deredy.;adult- alpha rhythm- article- clinical article- controlled study- female- human- human experiment- male- oscillation- prediction- steady state- visual evoked potential- visual stimulation;English;Article

This synchronization defines the generation of steady-state evoked responses (i.e., oscillations in the electroencephalogram phase-locked to the driving stimuli). The classic interpretation of the amplitude of the steady-state evoked responses assumes a stereotypical time-invariant neural response plus random background fluctuations, such that averaging over repeated presentations of the stimulus recovers the stereotypical response. This approach ignores the dynamics of the steady-state, as in the case of the adaptation elicited by prolonged exposures to the stimulus. To analyze the dynamics of steady-state responses, it can be assumed that the time evolution of the response amplitude is the same in different stimulation runs separated by sufficiently long breaks. Based on this assumption, a method to characterize the time evolution of steady-state responses is presented. A sufficiently large number of recordings are acquired in response to the same experimental condition. Experimental runs (recordings) are column-wise averaged (i.e., runs are averaged but epoch within recordings are not averaged with the preceding segments). The column-wise averaging allows analysis of steady-state responses in recordings with remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore, the averaged signal provides an accurate representation of the time evolution of the steady-state response, which can be analyzed in both the time and frequency domains.

The first step of brain network analysis in fMRI is to detect regions of interest (ROIs). The signals from these ROIs are then used to evaluate neural networks and quantify neuronal dynamics. The two main methods to identify ROIs are based on brain atlas registration and clustering. This work proposes a bioinspired method that combines both paradigms. The method, dubbed HAnt, consists of an anatomical clustering of the signal followed by an ant clustering step. The method is evaluated empirically in both in silico and in vivo experiments. The results show a significantly better performance of the proposed approach compared to other brain parcellations obtained using purely clustering-based strategies or atlas-based parcellations. © 2019 Alejandro Veloz et al.;Ant colony optimization- Magnetic resonance imaging- Ant clustering- Ant colony clustering- Bio-inspired methods- Brain networks- Functional magnetic resonance imaging- In-vivo experiments- Neuronal dynamics- Regions of interest- Functional neuroimaging- adult- algorithm- book- brain- brain mapping- cluster analysis- computer simulation- diagnostic imaging- female- hearing- human- image processing- male- nuclear magnetic resonance imaging- physiology- procedures- young adult- Adult- Algorithms- Atlases as Topic- Auditory Perception- Brain- Brain Mapping- Cluster Analysis- Computer Simulation- Female- Humans- Image Processing, Computer-Assisted- Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Male- Young Adult;English;Article

This behavior is partially due to the adaptation of the ASSR induced by the continuous and monotonous stimulation. In this study, we analyzed the potential clinical relevance of the ASSR adaptation. ASSR were elicited in eight anesthetized adult rats by 8-kHz tones, modulated in amplitude at 115 Hz. We called independent epochs to those EEG epochs acquired with sufficiently long interstimulus interval, so the ASSR contained in any given epoch is not affected by the previous stimulation. We tested whether the detection of ASSRs is improved when the response is computed by averaging independent EEG epochs, containing only unadapted auditory responses. The improvements in the ASSR detection obtained with standard, weighted and sorted averaging were compared. In the absence of artifacts, when the ASSR was elicited by continuous acoustic stimulation, the computation of the ASSR amplitude relied upon the averaging method. While the adaptive behavior of the ASSR was still evident after the weighting of epochs, the sorted averaging resulted in under-estimations of the ASSR amplitude. In the absence of artifacts, the ASSR amplitudes computed by averaging independent epochs did not depend on the averaging procedure. Averaging independent epochs resulted in higher ASSR amplitudes and halved the number of EEG epochs needed to be acquired to achieve the maximum detection rate of the ASSR. Acquisition protocols based on averaging independent EEG epochs, in combination with appropriate averaging methods for artifact reduction might contribute to develop more accurate hearing assessments based on ASSRs. © 2019 Prado-Gutierrez et al.

Wearable technologies combined with a proper data analysis provide a low cost option to monitor chest and abdominal wall movements. Here we set out to determine the feasibility of using accelerometry and machine learning to detect chest-abdominal wall movement patterns during tidal breathing. Furthermore, we determined the accelerometer positions included in the clusters, considering principal component domains. Eleven healthy participants (age: 21 ± 0.2 y, BMI: 23.4 ± 0.7 kg/m2, FEV1: 4.1 ± 0.3 L, VO2: 4.6 ± 0.2 mL/min kg) were included in this cross-sectional study. Spirometry and ergospirometry assessments were performed with participants seated with 13 accelerometers placed over the thorax. Data collection lasted 10 min. Following signal pre-processing, principal components and clustering analyses were performed. The Euclidean distances in respect to centroids were compared between the clusters (p &lt- 0.05), identifying two clusters (p &lt- 0.001). The first cluster included sensors located at the right and left second rib midline, body of sternum, left fourth rib midline, right and left second thoracic vertebra midline, and fifth thoracic vertebra. The second cluster included sensors at the fourth right rib midline, right and left seventh ribs, abdomen at linea alba, and right and left tenth thoracic vertebra midline. Costal-superior and costal-abdominal patterns were also recognized. We conclude that accelerometers placed on the chest and abdominal wall permit the identification of two clusters of movements regarding respiration biomechanics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;abdominal wall- adult- algorithm- Article- automation- biomechanics- breathing pattern- cross-sectional study- feasibility study- female- human- human experiment- machine learning- male- observational study- priority journal- spirometry- abdomen- accelerometry- breathing mechanics- devices- movement (physiology)- normal human- physiology- procedures- skeletal muscle- thorax- tidal volume- young adult- Abdomen- Accelerometry- Adult- Cross-Sectional Studies- Female- Healthy Volunteers- Humans- Male- Movement- Muscle, Skeletal- Respiratory Mechanics- Spirometry- Thorax- Tidal Volume- Young Adult;English;Article

These devices are commonly the same as those used in hospitals by healthcare professionals. The use of these these devices by lay users outside of a clinical environment may become unsafe. This study presents a methodology that allows decision makers to identify potential risk situations that may arise when lay users operate healthcare medical devices at home. Through a usability study based on the Grounded Theory methodology, we create a conceptual model in which we identified problems and errors related to the use of a multi-parameter monitor in a home environment by a group of lay users. The conceptual model is reified as a graphical representation, which allows stakeholders to identify (i) the weaknesses of the device, (ii) unsafe operation modes, and (iii) the most suitable device for a specific user. © 2018 Reyes et al.

In addition, several jobs require working shifts where workers are exposed to repetitive cycles of hypobaric hypoxia and normobaric normoxia. Currently, few is known about the biomechanical cardiovascular responses of this condition. In the present study, we investigate the cycle-dependent biomechanical effects of intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) on the thoracic aorta artery, in terms of both structure and function. To determine the vascular effects of IHH, functional, mechanical and histological approaches were carried out in the thoracic aorta artery, using uniaxial, pre-stretch, ring opening, myography, and histological tests. Three groups of rats were established: control (normobaric normoxia, NN), 4-cycles of intermittent hypoxia (short-term intermittent hypobaric hypoxia, STH), and 10-cycles of intermittent hypoxia (long-term intermittent hypobaric hypoxia, LTH). The pre-stretch and ring opening tests, aimed at quantifying residual strains of the tissues in longitudinal and circumferential directions, showed that the hypoxia condition leads to an increase in the longitudinal stretch and a marked decrease of the circumferential residual strain. The uniaxial mechanical tests were used to determine the elastic properties of the tissues, showing that a general stiffening process occurs during the early stages of the IH (STH group), specially leading to a significative increase in the high strain elastic modulus (E2) and an increasing trend of low strain elastic modulus (E1). In contrast, the LTH group showed a more control-like mechanical behavior. Myography test, used to assess the vasoactive function, revealed that IH induces a high sensitivity to vasoconstrictor agents as a function of hypoxic cycles. In addition, the aorta showed an increased muscle-dependent vasorelaxation on the LTH group. Histological tests, used to quantify the elastic fiber, nuclei, and geometrical properties, showed that the STH group presents a state of vascular fibrosis, with a significant increase in elastin content, and a tendency towards an increase in collagen fibers. In addition, advanced stages of IH (LTH), showed a vascular remodeling effect with a significant increase of internal and external diameters. Considering all the multidimensional vascular effects, we propose the existence of a long-term passive adaptation mechanism and vascular dysfunction as cycle-dependent effects of intermittent exposures to hypobaric hypoxia. © 2022, The Author(s).;altitude disease- animal- aorta- heart- hypoxia- pathology- physiology- rat- vasodilatation- Altitude Sickness- Animals- Aorta- Heart- Hypoxia- Rats- Vasodilation;English;Article

Although the study of shell biomechanical properties with nacreous microstructure has provided understanding about the role of shell integrity and functionality on mollusk performance and survival, there are no studies, to our knowledge, that delve into the variability of these properties during the mollusk ontogeny, between both shells of bivalves or across the shell length. In this study, using as a model the intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus to obtain, for the first time, the mechanical properties of its shells with nacreous microstructure- we perform uniaxial compression tests oriented in three orthogonal axes corresponding to the orthotropic directions of the shell material behavior (thickness, longitudinal, and transversal). Thus, we evaluated whether the shell material’s stress and strain strength and elastic modulus showed differences in mechanical behavior in mussels of different sizes, between valves, and across the shell length. Our results showed that the biomechanical properties of the material building the P. purpuratus shells are symmetrical in both valves and homogeneous across the shell length. However, uniaxial compression tests performed across the shell thickness showed that biomechanical performance depends on the shell size (aging)- and that mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus, maximum stress, and strain become degraded during ontogeny. SEM observations evidenced that compression induced a tortuous fracture with a delamination effect on the aragonite mineralogical structure of the shell. Findings suggest that P. purpuratus may become vulnerable to durophagous predators and wave forces in older stages, with implications in mussel beds ecology and biodiversity of intertidal habitats. © 2022, The Author(s).;anatomy and histology- animal- animal shell- biomechanics- compressive strength- ecosystem- elasticity- mollusc- physiology- ultrastructure- Animal Shells- Animals- Biomechanical Phenomena- Compressive Strength- Ecosystem- Elasticity- Mollusca;English;Article

In coastal systems, trematode parasites affect their hosts by disrupting their life-history traits. However, the effects of parasitism could be variable and dependent on the prevailing environmental conditions where the host-parasite interaction occurs. This study compared the effect of a trematode parasite in the family Renicolidae (metacercariae) on the body size and the shell organic and mechanical characteristics of the intertidal mussels Perumytilus purpuratus, inhabiting two environmentally contrasting localities in northern and central Chile (ca. 1600 km apart). Congruent with the environmental gradient along the Chilean coast, higher levels of temperature, salinity and pCO2, and a lower pH characterise the northern locality compared to that of central Chile. In the north, parasitised individuals showed lower body size and shell resistance than non-parasitised individuals, while in central Chile, the opposite pattern was observed. Protein level in the organic matter of the shell was lower in the parasitised hosts than in the non-parasitised ones regardless of the locality. However, an increase in polysaccharide levels was observed in the parasitised individuals from central Chile. These results evidence that body size and shell properties of P. purpuratus vary between local populations and that they respond differently when confronting the parasitism impacts. Considering that the parasite prevalence reaches around 50% in both populations, if parasitism is not included in the analysis, the true response of the host species would be masked by the effects of the parasite, skewing our understanding of how environmental variables will affect marine species. Considering parasitism and identifying its effects on host species faced with environmental drivers is essential to understand and accurately predict the ecological consequences of climate change. © 2022;Anthropometry- Climate change- Ecology- Shells (structures)- Body sizes- Central Chile- Environmental variability- Environmental variations- Mechanical response- Morphological response- Organics- Parasite-- Productivity/upwelling- Trematode metacercaria- Molluscs- carbon dioxide- organic matter- polysaccharide- protein- bivalve- body size- host-parasite interaction- interspecific interaction- morphology- parasitism- salinity- upwelling- animal shell- Article- biomechanics- bivalve- body size- Chile- climate change- controlled study- environmental factor- intertidal species- metacercaria- mussel- nonhuman- ocean acidification- parasite prevalence- parasitism- Perumytilus purpuratus- Renicolidae- salinity- seawater upwelling- trematode- water temperature- animal- human- metacercaria- Mytilidae- physiology- symbiosis- trematode- Chile- Animals- Climate Change- Humans- Metacercariae- Mytilidae- Symbiosis- Trematoda;English;Article

At present there is a lack of data on the mechanical performance of agar biopolymer films using a simple plasticizer. This study takes a Design of Experiments approach to analyze how agar-glycerin biopolymer films perform across a range of ingredients concentrations in terms of their strength, elasticity, and ductility. Our results demonstrate that by systematically varying the quantity of agar and glycerin, tensile properties can be achieved that are comparable to agar-based materials with more complex formulations. Not only does our study significantly broaden the amount of data available on the range of mechanical performance that can be achieved with simple agar biopolymer films, but the data can also be used to guide further optimization efforts that start with a basic formulation that performs well on certain property dimensions. We also find that select formulations have similar tensile properties to thermoplastic starch (TPS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polypropylene (PP), indicating potential suit-ability for select packaging applications. We use our experimental dataset to train a neural network regression model that predicts the Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation at break of agar biopolymer films given their composition. Our findings support the development of further data-driven design and fabrication workflows. © 2022 by the authors.

In order to achieve an accurate description of the elastoplastic material response in sheet forming operations, this work presents a detailed material and damage characterization of EK4 deep drawing steel through a two-step methodology involving both experiments and finite element simulations. Firstly, tensile tests on sheet samples cut along the rolling, diagonal and transverse directions were carried out. The corresponding measurements were used to calibrate the material parameters related to the following modeling approaches adopted in the present study: the Hollomon hardening law, the non-associated Hill-48 phenomenological constitutive model and the anisotropic Hosford-Coulomb ductile fracture criterion. Secondly, this characterization was assessed and validated in the numerical simulation of the technological Erichsen test in which the material is mainly subjected to a biaxial stress state. The obtained predictions show a good agreement when compared with the corresponding experimental measurements of the punch load–displacement curve and thickness radial profile at the final fracture stage of the sample. © 2022 by the authors.

This worldwide trend can be mainly attributed to the reduced environmental impact of building with timber, its high strength-to-weight ratio and its renewable material nature. Nevertheless, in spite of the advantages of building with timber, one of its major disadvantages is its time-dependent structural response. For instance, typical floors and beams made of timber may show decreasing stress levels under constant deformation over time. This phenomenon is known as stress relaxation and can also be affected heavily by environmental factors, such as temperature and moisture changes. This has inevitably led to discourage the use of timber in the construction industry. Due to the relevance of this subject, the present paper addresses the stress relaxation phenomenon in timber specimens subjected to three-point bending loads. In particular, radiata pine species is chosen for this investigation given its popularity as a building material in countries like Australia, Chile, Spain and New Zealand, among others. To investigate experimentally the influence of temperature and relative humidity on the stress relaxation at different deformation states, an environmental chamber was built. The stress relaxation is assessed indirectly by monitoring the relaxation of the load required to maintain the amount of deformation fixed in time inside the environmental test chamber. The experimental results show that within a period of 7 days, the percentage of load relaxation may reach a value of 35% approximately, for a fixed relative humidity of 60% and constant temperature of 27∘C. The present experimental results provide further insight into the time-dependent mechanisms of timber which are still not well-understood, and particularly of those structures made of radiata pine grown in Chile on which only limited experimental data has been reported to date. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Construction industry- Deformation- Environmental chambers- Environmental impact- Environmental testing- Stress relaxation- %moisture- Construction sectors- Environmental factors- High-strength- Radiata pine- Renewable materials- Strength to weight ratio- Stress levels- Structural response- Time dependent- Timber- Deformation- Humidity- Loads- Pinus Radiata- Stress Relaxation- Temperature;English;Article

In the current work, we prepared polycaprolactone (PCL) composite films with β-cyclodextrin (βCD) or its epichlorohydrin crosslinked polymer (βCDP) as ibuprofen (Ibu) drug carrier. The composite films were prepared at different PCL/additive ratios (2, 5, 10 and 20 wt%). ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and water contact angle (WCA) measurements indicated a scarce presence of the additives on the surface. Cross-section scanning electron micrographs showed the presence of aggregates corresponding to βCD and βCDP in the inner regions of the films. The incorporation of βCD and βCDP into the PCL films did not affect their thermal properties as was determined from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). PCL-films with 10 wt% of the inclusion complexes Ibu@βCD and Ibu@βCDP were prepared and the release studies were performed.

Marine organisms producing carbonate shells are regarded as vulnerable to these physical (warming), and chemical (acidification) changes occurring in the oceans. In the last decade, the aquaculture production of the bivalve scallop Argopecten purpuratus (AP) showed declined trends along the Chilean coast. These negative trends have been ascribed to ecophysiological and biomineralization constraints in shell carbonate production. This work experimentally characterizes the biomechanical response of AP scallop shells subjected to climate change scenarios (acidification and warming) via quasi-static tensile and bending tests. The experimental results indicate the adaptation of mechanical properties to hostile growth scenarios in terms of temperature and water acidification. In addition, the mechanical response of the AP subjected to control climate conditions was analyzed with finite element simulations including an anisotropic elastic constitutive model for a two-fold purpose: Firstly, to calibrate the material model parameters using the tensile test curves in two mutually perpendicular directions (representative of the mechanical behavior of the material). Secondly, to validate this characterization procedure in predicting the material’s behavior in two mechanical tests.

However, how these stressors affect structure and functionality of mollusk shells has received less attention. Episodic events of upwelling of deep cold and low pH waters are well documented in eastern boundary systems and may be stressful to mollusks, impairing both physiological and biomechanical performance. These events are projected to become more intense, and extensive in time with ongoing global warming. In this study, we evaluate the independent and interactive effects of temperature and pH on the biomineral and biomechanical properties of Argopecten purpuratus scallop shells. Total organic matter in the shell mineral increased under reduced pH (~ 7.7) and control conditions (pH ~ 8.0). The periostracum layer coating the outer shell surface showed increased protein content under low pH conditions but decreasing sulfate and polysaccharides content. Reduced pH negatively impacts shell density and increases the disorder in the orientation of calcite crystals. At elevated temperatures (18 °C), shell microhardness increased. Other biomechanical properties were not affected by pH/temperature treatments. Thus, under a reduction of 0.3 pH units and low temperature, the response of A. purpuratus was a tradeoff among organic compounds (biopolymer plasticity), density, and crystal organization (mineral plasticity) to maintain shell biomechanical performance, while increased temperature ameliorated the impacts on shell hardness. Biopolymer plasticity was associated with ecophysiological performance, indicating that, under the influence of natural fluctuations in pH and temperature, energetic constraints might be critical in modulating the long-term sustainability of this compensatory mechanism. © 2021, The Author(s).;;English;Article

Polyelectrolytes, such as acrylic acid, are a particular type of smart polymers that present pH responsiveness. This work aims to fabricate stable hydrogel films with reversible pH responsiveness that could spontaneously form wrinkled surface patterns. For this purpose, the photosensitive reaction mixtures were deposited via spin-coating over functionalized glasses. Following vacuum, UV, or either plasma treatments, it is possible to spontaneously form wrinkles, which could increase cell adherence. The pH responsiveness of the material was evaluated, observing an abrupt variation in the film thickness as a function of the environmental pH. Moreover, the presence of the carboxylic acid functional groups at the interface was evidenced by analyzing the adsorption/desorption capacity using methylene blue as a cationic dye model. The results demonstrated that increasing the acrylic acid in the microwrinkled hydrogel effectively improved the adsorption and release capacity and the ability of the carboxylic groups to establish ionic interactions with methylene blue. Finally, the role of the acrylic acid groups and the surface topography (smooth or wrinkled) on the final antibacterial properties were investigated, demonstrating their efficacy against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria model strains (E. coli and S. Aureus). According to our findings, microwrinkled hydrogels presented excellent antibacterial properties improving the results obtained for planar (smooth) hydrogels. © 2021 by the authors.

To this end, the mechanical response was studied via tensile and pressurization tests. The tensile and pressurization tests measurements were used simultaneously to calibrate the material parameters of the Gasser–Holzapfel–Ogden (GHO) hyperelasctic anisotropic constitutive model through an analytical-numerical optimization procedure solved with an evolutionary strategy that guarantees a stable response of the model. The model and procedure of calibration adequately adjust to the material behavior in a wide deformation range with an appropriate physical description. The results of this study predict the mechanical response of the lamb thoracic aorta under generalized loading states like those that can occur in physiological conditions and/or in systemic arterial hypertension. Finally, the novel use of the evolutionary strategy, together with the set of experiments and tools used in this study, provide a robust alternative to validate biomechanical characterizations. © 2021, The Author(s).;algorithm- animal- biomechanics- chronic disease- computer simulation- evolution- hypoxia- mechanical stress- newborn- pathophysiology- pressure- sheep- tensile strength- thoracic aorta- Young modulus- Algorithms- Animals- Animals, Newborn- Aorta, Thoracic- Biological Evolution- Biomechanical Phenomena- Chronic Disease- Computer Simulation- Elastic Modulus- Hypoxia- Pressure- Sheep- Stress, Mechanical- Tensile Strength;English;Article

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of AFL in small- and medium-caliber airways with BC in young adults. Methods: Eighty-three individuals were recruited (40 men and 43 women). To determine AFL, the following measurements were taken: forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% (FEF25–75%), airway resistance (Raw), and specific airway resistance (sRaw). The measured BC variables were body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF), and fat-free mass (FFM). Binary logistical regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the AFL variables and %BF, BMI, and %FFM, adjusting for weight and gender. Results: Among men, a relationship was observed between Raw and %BF (r = 0.728- p &lt- 0.0001) and sRaw and BMI (r = 0.617- p &lt- 0.0001). Among women, significant relationships were reported between Raw and BMI (r = 0.615- p &lt- 0.0001) and sRaw and BMI (r = 0.556- p &lt- 0.0001). Among participants with a BMI over 30 kg/m2, higher risks of increased Raw (OR = 26.8- p = 0.009) and sRaw (OR = 9.3- p = 0.002) were observed. Furthermore, higher %BF was associated with greater risks for increased Raw (OR = 14.04- p = 0.030) and sRaw (OR = 4.14- p = 0.028). In contrast, increased %FFM (OR = 0.14- p = 0.025) was a protective factor for lung function. Conclusion: Increased %BF is associated with increased AFL in small-caliber airways. Furthermore, increased %FFM is associated with decreased risk for Raw and sRaw in women. Therefore, evidence indicates that increased %FFM is a protective factor for adequate lung function. © 2021, The Author(s).;adult- airway resistance- body composition- body mass- cross-sectional study- female- forced expiratory volume- human- male- obesity- pathophysiology- physiology- young adult- Adult- Airway Resistance- Body Composition- Body Mass Index- Cross-Sectional Studies- Female- Forced Expiratory Volume- Humans- Male- Obesity- Young Adult;English;Article

In this work we propose the use of the biopolymer from a highly invasive microalgae, Didymosphenia geminata or Didymo, as lead adsorbent in a nanostructured membrane designed to facilitate heavy metal removal applications. Nanofibrilated cellulose was used as a membrane matrix, due to its non-toxic nature and good reinforcement abilities. In addition multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced into the membrane to improve structural and antifouling performance, which are critical aspects for membrane applications. The kinetics and nature of the adsorption process of the membrane were evaluated, confirming a high lead adsorption capacity (129 mg g-1), when compared to other biopolymers from micro and macroalgae. According to our measurements, this adsorption is connected to the presence of sulphur-based functional groups in the Didymo biopolymer. When CNTs are added to the membrane its adsorption capacity increases, probably due to an increment of the membrane porosity and molecular diffusion. Antifouling and mechanical properties of the Didymo-based membranes were also explored. Phylogenetic studies confirmed the presence of only one genetic lineage of D. geminata found in all locations affected by this plague in Chile. The availability of biopolymer in the region with reproducible lead adsorption results increases the potential applicability of this biomaterial by adding value to a species well-known for having negative impacts on ecosystems and human activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.;Adsorption- Biofilms- Biomolecules- Biopolymers- Chemicals removal (water treatment)- Membranes- Microorganisms- Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)- Adsorption capacities- Aqueous environment- Didymosphenia geminata- Heavy metal removal- Lead adsorption- Membrane matrix- Micro-algae- Nano-structured- Nanostructured membranes- Phylogenetic analysis- Heavy metals- Adsorption- Capacity- Diffusion- Ecosystems- Lead- Membranes- Processes- Reinforcement;English;Article

PCMs are used as heat storage materials to reduce the temperature peaks and displace the thermal loads in an enclosed space. It is important to study the effect of PCMs on the mechanical properties of wood, since these composite materials are intended to be used as a structural materials in low-thermal-mass housing, wherein a reduction in mechanical properties can generate structural resistance problems. For this purpose, tensile and compression tests were performed in the three principle directions (longitudinal, radial, and tangential) and bending tests were performed in the longitudinal direction. These mechanical tests were carried out using non-impregnated wood and PCM-impregnated wood, which was fabricated using a double vacuum method consisting of alternately applying a vacuum and atmospheric conditions. Different impregnation yields could be visualized using computerized microtomography, and different mechanical behaviors in the three principle directions were observed- the results showed an orthotropic behavior. However, the longitudinal direction exhibited the highest mechanical resistance. In general, the statistical tests showed that the mechanical performances of the wood samples were not affected by octadecane impregnation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Bending tests- Composite structures- Compression testing- Heat storage- Impregnation- Mechanical properties- Phase change materials- Atmospheric conditions- Computerized microtomography- Longitudinal direction- Mechanical performance- Mechanical properties of wood- Mechanical resistance- Shape stabilized phase change material- Structural resistance- Wood;English;Article

Libertador Bernardo O’Higgins 3363, Estación Central, Santiago de Chile, Chile;A proper management of agro-industrial waste is strongly required since these residues represent an alternative energy source. In this study, it was conducted the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of rapeseed meal, which is a biomass waste from the rapeseed oil extraction process that shows interesting properties in terms of calorific value. The effect of the reaction temperature was evaluated on basic fuel properties, pellet quality, and emissions from a pellet stove. First, the mass yields were decreased as reaction temperature increased showing significant mass loses even at low HTC temperatures. The higher heating values were, conversely, increased with temperature reaching an improvement of more than 30% compared to raw biomass. On the other hand, the ash content was dramatically reduced at 150 °C- however, an increasing trend was observed as temperature rose. About the pellet quality, moisture uptake and compression strength tests were performed resulting in hydrochar pellets showing enhanced hydrophobicity and durability, which facilitates the storage and transportation of these novel pellets. Finally, combustion tests in a household pellet stove were carried out to assess the effect of the HTC process on the air pollution control from residential combustion. Emissions from incomplete combustion such as CO and particulates were significantly diminished when burning hydrochar pellets obtained at low HTC temperatures, whereas NOX concentrations were gradually reduced with hydrochars obtained at higher temperatures. These findings definitely represent a promising contribution from biomass conversion technologies to take advantage of rapeseed meal residues, and also, to overcome the current scarcity of commercial pellets made of woody biomass. © 2021, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Salvador 486, Providencia, Santiago, Chile;In order to reliably assess the rupture-risk of the aorta – along with the hazardousness index of cardiovascular diseases or other extreme conditions, and the effect of possible treatments – it is necessary to know the damage mechanisms that lead to it. In this work, the mechanical damage of hypoxic aortic tissue is characterized, numerically predicting its response when subjected to a bulge-test type of pressurization state. The mechanical behavior of the aortic wall, is described using a hyperelastic material model with two transverse-isotropy directions and an isotropic damage model- both experimentally calibrated, from previously reported uniaxial tensile-test results, performed on thoracic aorta samples of lambs exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia. A melatonin-treated group is studied in contrast to a control group. Once the constitutive model is calibrated, its performance is evaluated via the numerical simulation of the bulge-pressurization test- in which the quasi-static response of a quarter-disk shaped structure, fixed along its curved perimeter, and loaded out of its plane by a pressure, or force per unit area permanently normal to the loaded area, its analyzed. The experimental data and the results of numerical simulations indicate that a melatonin treatment reduces the stiffness of the aorta. Moreover, the group-wise determined pressures, delivered by the bulge-test simulation and associated with the onset of damage, are compatible with an arterial hypertensive condition. © 2021, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

A particularly complex pathology is pulmonary arterial hypertension of the neonate (PHN), which is increased at HA due to hypobaric hypoxia. Basic and clinical research have recognized that new treatments are needed, because current ones are, in general, palliative and with low effectiveness. Therefore, recently we have proposed melatonin as a potential adjuvant treatment to improve cardiopulmonary function. However, melatonin effects on the mechanical response of the arteries and their microstructure are not known. This study assesses the effects of a neonatal treatment with daily low doses of melatonin on the passive biomechanical behavior of the aorta artery and main pulmonary artery of PHN lambs born in chronic hypobaric hypoxia (at 3600 masl). With this purpose, ex-vivo measurements were made on axial stretch, tensile and opening ring tests together with a histological analysis to explore the morphometry and microstructure of the arteries. Our results show that the passive mechanical properties of the aorta artery and main pulmonary artery of lambs do not seem to be affected by a treatment based on low melatonin doses. However, we found evidence that melatonin has microstructural effects, particularly, diminishing cell proliferation, which is an indicator of antiremodeling capacity. Therefore, the use of melatonin as an adjuvant against pathologies like PHN would present antiproliferative effect at the microstructural level, keeping the macroscopic properties of the aorta artery and main pulmonary artery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Blood vessels- Cardiology- Cell proliferation- Clinical research- Microstructure- Pathology- Sea level- Antiproliferative effect- Biomechanical behavior- Cardio-pulmonary function- Histological analysis- Macroscopic properties- Micro-structural effects- Microstructural levels- Pulmonary arterial hypertension- Hormones- melatonin- animal experiment- animal model- animal tissue- aorta- Article- biomechanics- chronic disease- controlled study- domestic sheep- ex vivo study- hypobarism- hypoxia- newborn- nonhuman- priority journal- pulmonary artery- pulmonary hypertension- animal- hypoxia- pulmonary hypertension- sheep- Animals- Animals, Newborn- Hypertension, Pulmonary- Hypoxia- Melatonin- Pulmonary Artery- Sheep;English;Article

To compare the different treatments, the mechanical responses of aorta, carotid, and femoral arterial walls were analyzed by means of axial pre-stretch and ring-opening tests, through a study with n = 6 animals for each group analyzed. The axial pre-stretch test measures the level of shortening in different zones of the arteries when extracted from lambs, while the ring-opening test is used to quantify the degree of residual circumferential deformation in a given zone of an artery. In addition, histological studies were carried out to measure elastin, collagen, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) nuclei densities, both in control and treated groups. The results show that mechanical response is related with histological results, specifically in the proximal abdominal aorta (PAA) and distal carotid zones (DCA), where the cell nuclei content is related to a decrease of residual deformations. The opening angle and the elastic fibers of the aorta artery were statistically correlated (p &lt- 0.05). Specifically, in PAA zone, there are significant differences of opening angle and cell nuclei density values between control and treated groups (p-values to opening angle: Control-ANP = 2 ⋅ 10–2, Control-Cinaciguat = 1 ⋅ 10–2- p-values to cell nuclei density: Control-ANP = 5 ⋅ 10–4, Control-Cinaciguat = 2 ⋅ 10–2). Respect to distal carotid zone (DCA), significant differences between Control and Cinaciguat groups were observed to opening angle (p-value = 4 ⋅ 10–2), and cell nuclei density (p-value = 1 ⋅ 10–2). Our findings add evidence that medical treatments may have effects on the mechanical responses of arterial walls and should be taken into account when evaluating the complete medical outcome. © Copyright © 2020 Navarrete, Chen, Aranda, Poblete, Utrera, García-Herrera, Gonzalez-Candia, Beñaldo, Ebensperger, Reyes, Herrera and Llanos.;Blood vessels- Cells- Deformation- Muscle- Peptides- Atrial natriuretic peptides- Circumferential deformations- Different treatments- Hypoxic condition- Mechanical response- Medical treatment- Residual deformation- Smooth muscle cells- Cytology;English;Article

One of the main features of this material is the necking formation at small strains levels causing the early development of non-homogeneous stress and strain patterns in the tested samples. Due to this fact, a robust inverse calibration approach, based on an experimental–analytical–numerical iterative predictor–corrector methodology, is proposed to obtain the constitutive material parameters. This fitting procedure, which uses tensile test measurements where the strains are obtained via digital image correlation (DIC), consists of three steps aimed at, respectively, determining (a) the parameters of the hardening model, (b) a first prediction of the Hill-48 parameters based on the Lankford coefficients and, (c) corrected parameters of the yield and flow potential functions that minimize the experimental–numerical error of the material response. Finally, this study shows that the mechanical characterization carried out in this context is capable of adequately predicting the behavior of the material in the bulge test. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a model for analyzing respiratory function according to body composition, by analyzing the structure and function of the airways by computed tomography (CT). Lung function and body fat percentage (BF%) were measured in three male subjects (25 ± 6 years), with different body mass index (BMI- normal, overweight, obese). A third-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the airways was performed using CT. Trachea, right and left main bronchi and anterior segmental bronchus of the right and left lung were measured. Three measurement points were established for each structure, and the average value of these three points was used for the analysis. An increase in the thickness of the airways wall of the left and right main bronchi and right segmental bronchus was observed as BMI and BF% increased. The same was observed for the percentage of airway wall area (%AWA) and airway resistance in the main and segmental bronchi. The proposed 3D reconstruction model and the three-point analysis simplified image assessment and allowed to observe the problems caused by obesity in lung function. © 2020, Universidad de la Frontera.

For instance, in marine ecosystems hosts and parasites are subject to environmental variability across latitudinal gradients, and their co-evolutionary dynamics may be the result of the interplay with local physical-chemical variables in seawater. Thus, assessing the environmental conditions required for a host in order to improve their survival is essential to understand the host-parasite interaction and dynamics. In this study, we evaluated the impact of parasitism by Proctoeces humboldti on the body size and reproduction of the intertidal keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa collected from three populations spanning ca. 1500 km along the latitudinal gradient of the Chilean coast. In addition, for the first time, we explore whether the effect of parasitism can be extended to changes in the organic composition and mechanical properties of the host shell. Our results show that parasitism prevalence and intensity, and body size of F. crassa increased in central Chile (ca. 33°S). Unlike body size, which was greater in parasitized limpets than in non-parasitized limpets at the three study sites, reproductive performance followed this trend only in central Chile populations, with no differences between parasitized and non-parasitized limpets collected in the northern Chilean (ca. 23°S), and lower in parasitized than non-parasitized individuals from the south-central Chile (ca. 37°S). The organic composition of F. crassa shells showed significant differences between parasite conditions (e.g. polysaccharides and water decreased in parasitized limpets) and across sites (e.g. proteins levels increase in shell of parasitized limpets from central Chile, but decreased at south-central Chile). However, variability in shell mechanical properties (e.g. toughness and elastic module) do not showed significant differences across sites and parasitism condition. These results suggest the interplay of both parasitism and environmental fluctuations upon the reproductive performance and morphology of the host. In addition, our result highlight that the host may also trade-offs reproduction, growth and shell organic composition to maintain the shell functionality (e.g. protection for mechanical forces and durophagous predators). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Anthropometry- Cell proliferation- Economic and social effects- Ecosystems- Toughness- Biological interactions- Environmental conditions- Environmental fluctuations- Environmental variability- Environmental variations- Geographical variability- Host-parasite interactions- Reproductive performance- Shells (structures)- polysaccharide- water- body size- geographical variation- intertidal environment- mollusc- parasite- parasitism- reproduction- shell- adult- animal shell- animal tissue- Article- body size- chemical composition- Chile- controlled study- Fissurella crassa- geographical variation (species)- keyhole limpet- mechanical stress- nonhuman- parasitism- reproduction- rigidity- seashore- Young modulus- animal- body size- ecosystem- epidemiology- human- mollusc- trematode- Chile- Fissurella crassa- Mollusca- Patellidae- Proctoeces- Vetigastropoda- Animals- Body Size- Chile- Ecosystem- Humans- Mollusca- Trematoda;English;Article

This study put together the effective heat storage capacity of an organic phase change material (O-PCM, octadecane) with the construction and production potential of Pinus radiata in Chile. The wood is impregnated with octadecane by using the Bethell method, showing that it has good retention of the impregnator, and that its size was not modified. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC) showed that the composite material could achieve fusion enthalpy values from 36 (20.8 MJ/m3) to 122 J/g (108.9 MJ/m3). The transient line heat source method used, indicated that impregnation of Pinus radiata with octadecane increases its specific heat at temperatures from 15 to 20 °C, while its thermal conductivity decreases in the radial and the tangent directions, and increases in the longitudinal direction, showing a decrease in the orthotropic behavior of the wood. The ability of Pinus radiata wood to store latent heat positioned it as a candidate material to be considered in the building industry as a heat storage system. © 2020 by the authors.;Construction industry- Differential scanning calorimetry- Heat storage- Impregnation- Specific heat- Thermal conductivity- Thermodynamic properties- Wood- Candidate materials- Heat storage capacity- Heat storage systems- Longitudinal direction- Octadecane- Orthotropic behavior- Pinus radiata- Thermal characterization- Phase change materials;English;Article

In recent years, the retina has received increased attention as a candidate for AD biomarkers since it appears to manifest the pathological signatures of the disease. Therefore, its electrical activity may hint at AD-related physiological changes. However, it is unclear how AD affects retinal electrophysiology and what tools are more appropriate to detect these possible changes. In this study, we used entropy tools to estimate the complexity of the dynamics of healthy and diseased retinas at different ages. We recorded microelectroretinogram responses to visual stimuli of different nature from retinas of young and adult, wild-type and 5xFAD—an animal model of AD—mice. To estimate the complexity of signals, we used the multiscale entropy approach, which calculates the entropy at several time scales using a coarse graining procedure. We found that young retinas had more complex responses to different visual stimuli. Further, the responses of young, wild-type retinas to natural-like stimuli exhibited significantly higher complexity than young, 5xFAD retinas. Our findings support a theory of complexity-loss with aging and disease and can have significant implications for early AD diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s).;aged- aging- Alzheimer disease- animal- disease model- entropy- human- mouse- pathology- retina- Aged- Aging- Alzheimer Disease- Animals- Disease Models, Animal- Entropy- Humans- Mice- Retina;English;Article

This information could provide us with new insights about the specialisation of organisms (or part of them), how they adapt, how similar they are with other species, among others. Unfortunately, this evolutionary history can only be estimated, and for that, several computational methods exist. Among the methods, optimisation methods are one of the main approaches to deal with this problem, with multiobjective optimisation producing promising results. In this paper, we deal with multiobjective phylogenetic inference, using a multi-modal metaheuristic approach that exploits the decision space in the multiobjective formulation of the problem. In particular, we incorporate a new metric based on a topological tree distance. We compare the method with state of the art algorithms in terms of performance. Additionally, we perform a thorough analysis of a study case on a yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset.

Multiple types of solutions have been devised depending on the specific problem considered, including ad-hoc heuristics and metaheuristic approaches. In this paper, we centre our attention on a particular clustering problem in which the sizes of the individual clusters are fixed a priori and where a membership restriction due to an initial classification is present. A novel formal description of the problem is presented, and an example of how it appears in practice as a post-processing step of non-negative matrix factorisation analysis is described. Adaptations of three classical single-solution based metaheuristic methods are proposed as possible solution strategies for this problem. Experiments are performed using synthetic data and then using a test dataset constructed from repeated NMF extractions of multiple face images. The efficacy of the various approaches is compared and discussed. © 2021 IEEE.;Matrix algebra- Statistical tests- Ad-hoc heuristics- Clustering problems- Formal Description- Heuristics approaches- Meta-heuristic approach- Metaheuristic- Nonnegative matrix factorization- Post-processing- Single-solution metaheuristic- Specific problems- Non-negative matrix factorization;English;Conference Paper

These measures include different approaches to assign and manage the resources, control the spread of the virus, and mitigate the contagious. The technical efficiency allows evaluating the success rate in government managing and health facilities performance. Since technical efficiency is a relative measure, experts must compare the hospitals by adjusting their production according to the type of patient treated: case-mix. The literature recommends using the Related Groups for Diagnosis system (DRG) to adjust hospitals' production. However, only 80 of the more than 195 public hospitals have implemented this system in Chile, limiting the evaluation of technical efficiency. The Ministry of Health of Chile (MINSAL) has proposed an administrative categorisation for the public hospitals: high, medium, and low complexity. Managers can use this classification to group the hospitals avoiding bias. However, how good is this classification according to the data science point of view? In this work, we evaluate the categorisation proposed by MINSAL by applying internal clustering indexes and input features associated with healthcare production related to case-mix, considering different clustering techniques and an ad-hoc NSGA-II strategy. After evaluating alternative partitions where the latter obtains the best quality scores, we propose a new classification for technical efficiency analyses. © 2021 IEEE.;Classification (of information)- Data Science- Diseases- Efficiency- Hospitals- Patient monitoring- Patient treatment- Viruses- Clustering methods- Clustering techniques- Diagnose system- Health facilities- Health informations- High complexity- Performance- Public healthcares- Resource control- Technical efficiency- Cluster analysis;English;Conference Paper

The 3D-PSP can be approached as a multi-objective optimisation problem by using different energy functions as objective functions and analyzing their conflicting roles in the protein structure conformation. This work examines the energy functions Talaris2013 and SASA of the molecular modelling suite PyRosetta, using a version of the multi-objective NSGA-II algorithm, plus a local search heuristics and the use of the Angle Probability List to incorporate structural information in the optimisation process. The experiment results showed the different aspects each energy function evaluates and the better structure prediction when used together in a multi-objective approach than separately in the optimisation process.

The use of several distinct biological evidence has shown to produce more resolved phylogenies than single evidence approaches. Currently, two conflicting paradigms are applied to combine biological evidence: taxonomic congruence (TC) and total evidence (TE). Although the literature recommends the application of these paradigms depending on the congruence of the input data, the resultant evolutionary hypotheses could vary according to the strategy used to combine the biological evidence biasing the resultant topologies of the trees. In this work, we evaluate the ability of different strategies associated with both paradigms to produce integrated evolutionary hypotheses by considering different features of the data: missing biological evidence, diversity among sequences, complexity, and congruence. Using datasets from the literature, we compare the resultant trees with reference hypotheses obtained by applying two inference criteria: maximum parsimony and likelihood. The results show that methods associated with TE paradigm are more robust compared to TC methods, obtaining trees with more similar topologies in relation to reference trees. These results are obtained regardless of (1) the features of the data, (2) the estimated evolutionary rates, and (3) the criteria used to infer the reference evolutionary hypotheses. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.;article- consensus- evolutionary rate- intermethod comparison- animal- Bayes theorem- biological model- biology- classification- comparative study- consensus sequence- evolution- genetic database- genetics- human- least square analysis- phylogeny- primate- procedures- software- statistical model- Animals- Bayes Theorem- Biological Evolution- Classification- Computational Biology- Consensus Sequence- Databases, Genetic- Humans- Least-Squares Analysis- Likelihood Functions- Models, Genetic- Phylogeny- Primates- Software;English;Article

Also, distributed generation (mainly Solar Photovoltaic) and distributed storage (mainly electro-chemical batteries) have arisen as an alternative to reduce electric bills. In general, the problem of selecting a specific photovoltaic and energy storage system size is NP-hard, as the trade-off between tariff mechanisms and photovoltaic and energy storage energy relationships is difficult- also, distribution customers may not have specific knowledge of the underlying optimization problem nor how to formulate an analysis in particular. This work considers the particular case of the Chilean distribution tariff mechanism to propose an easy-To-implement algorithm to obtain an near-optimal solution to the photovoltaic and energy storage sizing system, maximizing the economic return. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.;Economic and social effects- NP-hard- Optimization- Chemical batteries- Distributed storage- Energy storage systems- Near-optimal solutions- Optimization problems- Sizing algorithms- Solar photovoltaics- Specific knowledge- Electric energy storage;English;Conference Paper

Several universities around the world have performed studies evaluating their programs by contrasting the planned and effective academic load using a credit system. Most of them have used strategies based on interviews, surveys, questionnaires and logbooks to quantify the effective load. In addition, it has become necessary to define academic programs with activities and load planned according to a uniform criterion. To evaluate the programs of our department, we propose a strategy based on three stages: (1) the designing of an informatic tool which allows academics to plan the class-To-class activities of each course by considering load, (2) holding a set of meetings with academics and students to discuss the planned and effective load of the courses, and (3) a study of the balance of the load between the different weeks of the semesters. In this manuscript, we describe the first stage of the strategy associated with the informatics tool. © 2020 IEEE.;Informatics- Academic program- Credit system- Critical component- Educational process- Surveys;English;Conference Paper

To evaluate technical efficiency performing fairly comparisons it is necessary to group the hospitals according to the type of patient treated: case-mix. Generally, this evaluation is performed by using the Related Groups for Diagnosis (DRG) system. Since only a few hospitals have implemented this system in Chile, the analysis of technical efficiency results limited the Ministry of Health of Chile (MINSAL) has proposed an administrative categorisation for the public hospitals: high, medium and low complexity. However, it has not been studied if this definition is associated to the case-mix and if it can be used to study technical efficiency. In this work, we propose an ad-hoc genetic algorithm which combines filter feature selection and clustering strategies to determine if there is a set of features related to the case-mix that allow to reach the same categorisation proposed by the MINSAL the results show that, although a small set of features is able to reach this categorisation by year, there is not enough evidence to establish a relationship with the case-mix. It is recommended that future technical efficiency analyses use new categorisations based on case-mix instead of the MINSAL categorisation. © 2020 IEEE.;Efficiency- Hospitals- Patient monitoring- Patient treatment- Clustering strategy- Genetic algorithm approach- Healthcare services- Technical efficiency- Genetic algorithms;English;Conference Paper

These resultant evolutionary histories are often represented as phylogenetic trees. In computer science, the phylogenetic inference has been treated as an optimisation problem. The literature has proposed different criteria to select the optimal tree between the possible topologies. In order to reduce the bias associated to the dependency on the selected criterion, different multi-objective optimisation strategies have been proposed during the last decade. These strategies search by solutions using operators and metrics based on the objective space. However, a recent work concluded that the topological features of the trees (decision space) and the objective space in the multi-objective phylogenetic inference context are not related, becoming phylogeny in a multimodal problem. It means that the current multi-objective strategies could discard solutions from different regions of the decision space, limiting the searching process and the resultant topologies. In this work, we propose a new version of the Memetic algorithm based on an NSGA-II scheme for phylogenetic inference, which include a multimodal operator that considers the diversity of the topologies of the trees based on the decision space to rank the solutions. The inclusion of this operator improved the diversity of solutions according to the decision and the objective space, increasing the hypervolume metric compared to the base version of this memetic algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.;Bioinformatics- Biology- Evolutionary algorithms- Inference engines- Intelligent computing- Topology- Trees (mathematics)- Diversity of solutions- Evolutionary history- Evolutionary relationships- Multi-objective strategies- Multimodal problems- Optimisation problems- Phylogenetic inference- Topological features- Multiobjective optimization;English;Conference Paper

The recent “1002 yeast genomes project” has become the most complete catalogue of yeast genetic diversity and a powerful resource to analyse the evolutionary history of genes affecting specific phenotypes. In this work, we selected 22 nitrogen associated genes and analysed the sequence information from the 1011 strains of the “1002 yeast genomes project”. We constructed a total evidence (TE) phylogenetic tree using concatenated information, which showed a 27% topology similarity with the reference (REF) tree of the “1002 yeast genomes project”. We also generated individual phylogenetic trees for each gene and compared their topologies, identifying genes with similar topologies (suggesting a shared evolutionary history). Furthermore, we pruned the constructed phylogenetic trees to compare the REF tree topology versus the TE tree and the individual genes trees, considering each phylogenetic cluster/subcluster within the population, observing genes with cluster/subcluster topologies of high similarity to the REF tree. Finally, we used the pruned versions of the phylogenetic trees to compare four strains considered as representatives of S. cerevisiae clean lineages, observing for 15 genes that its cluster topologies match 100% the REF tree, supporting that these strains represent main lineages of yeast population. Altogether, our results showed the potential of tree topologies comparison for exploring the evolutionary history of a specific group of genes. © 2019 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is qualitative/interpretive and uses of the concept of functional homomorphism of WR Ashby is used, establishing similarities between the way in which this ancient medicine considers the human being and their condition as healthy to transfer it to an organization that produces goods and/or services. Findings: A healthy organization is conceived as one constituted by an association of people regulated by a set of norms based on certain purposes in a state of harmonious balance of their physical and energetic dimensions. In that the physical refers to storage functions, regulation and allocation of resources- transformation of raw materials and inputs into goods and services- waste disposal, distribution and coordination and with information systems for management control, while energy is associated with the ability to act with its management and policies. Research limitations/implications: The current paper is a first theoretical proposal, which should be enriched with practical applications that feedback its conceptual formulation, thus contributing to its validation. Practical implications: A comprehensive organizational diagnostic method is made available. Social implications: The proposed method allows a comprehensive organizational diagnosis, considering the participation of all the actors that make up this type of social systems.

In recent years, the retina has received increased attention as a candidate for AD biomarkers since it appears to manifest the pathological signatures of the disease. Therefore, its electrical activity may hint at AD-related physiological changes. However, it is unclear how AD affects retinal electrophysiology and what tools are more appropriate to detect these possible changes. In this study, we used entropy tools to estimate the complexity of the dynamics of healthy and diseased retinas at different ages. We recorded microelectroretinogram responses to visual stimuli of different nature from retinas of young and adult, wild-type and 5xFAD—an animal model of AD—mice. To estimate the complexity of signals, we used the multiscale entropy approach, which calculates the entropy at several time scales using a coarse graining procedure. We found that young retinas had more complex responses to different visual stimuli. Further, the responses of young, wild-type retinas to natural-like stimuli exhibited significantly higher complexity than young, 5xFAD retinas. Our findings support a theory of complexity-loss with aging and disease and can have significant implications for early AD diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s).;aged- aging- Alzheimer disease- animal- disease model- entropy- human- mouse- pathology- retina- Aged- Aging- Alzheimer Disease- Animals- Disease Models, Animal- Entropy- Humans- Mice- Retina;English;Article

Alameda N◦3336, Estación Central, Santiago, 9170022, Chile;The mechanism of cerebral blood flow autoregulation can be of great importance in diagnosing and controlling a diversity of cerebrovascular pathologies such as vascular dementia, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. To assess it, there are several methods that use changing postures, such as sit-stand or squat-stand maneuvers. However, the evaluation of the dynamic cerebral blood flow autoregulation (dCA) in these postures has not been adequately studied using more complex models, such as non-linear ones. Moreover, dCA can be considered part of a more complex mechanism called cerebral hemodynamics, where others (CO2 reactivity and neurovascular-coupling) that affect cerebral blood flow (BF) are included. In this work, we analyzed postural influences using non-linear machine learning models of dCA and studied characteristics of cerebral hemodynamics under statistical complexity using eighteen young adult subjects, aged 27 ± 6.29 years, who took the systemic or arterial blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) for five minutes in three different postures: stand, sit, and lay. With models of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) through time, we used an AutoRegulatory Index (ARI) to compare the dCA in different postures. Using wavelet entropy, we estimated the statistical complexity of BFV for three postures. Repeated measures ANOVA showed that only the complexity of lay-sit had significant differences. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;;English;Article

This study aimed to quantify the separate contributions of vascular resistance and compliance as parameters that could reflect myogenic and metabolic mechanisms to dCA. Methods: Forty-five subjects were studied under normo and hypercapnic conditions induced by breathing a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide in air. Dynamic cerebrovascular resistance and compliance models with ABP as input and CBFV as output were fitted using Genetic Algorithms to identify parameter values for each subject, and respiratory condition. Results: The efficiency of dCA was assessed from the model's generated CBFV response to an ABP step change, corresponding to an autoregulation index of 5.56 ± 1.57 in normocapnia and 2.38 ± 1.73 in hypercapnia, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9 between both conditions. Vascular compliance increased from 0.75 ± 0.7 ml/mmHg in normocapnia to 5.82 ± 12.0 ml/mmHg during hypercapnia, with an AUC of 0.88. Conclusion: Further work is needed to validate this approach in clinical applications where individualised model parameters could provide relevant diagnostic and prognostic information about dCA impairment. © 2012 IEEE.;Blood- Blood pressure- Carbon dioxide- Hemodynamics- Parameter estimation- Area under the ROC curve- Arterial blood pressure- Arterial compliance- Cerebral autoregulation- Clinical application- Identification of model- Metabolic mechanism- Vascular compliance- Genetic algorithms- carbon dioxide- adult- air- arterial pressure- artery compliance- artery resistance- Article- autoregulation- blood flow velocity- bootstrapping- brain blood flow- breathing- correlation coefficient- dynamic cerebral autoregulation- genetic algorithm- hemodynamics- human- human experiment- hypercapnia- intermethod comparison- mean squared error- measurement accuracy- metabolism- muscle development- process optimization- receiver operating characteristic- reproducibility- sensitivity analysis- support vector machine- algorithm- blood pressure- brain circulation- homeostasis- hypercapnia- Algorithms- Blood Flow Velocity- Blood Pressure- Cerebrovascular Circulation- Homeostasis- Humans- Hypercapnia;English;Article

There is emerging evidence that analysing the entropy and complexity of biomedical signals can detect underlying changes in physiology which may be reflective of disease pathology. This approach can be used even when only short recordings of biomedical signals are available. This study aimed to determine whether entropy and complexity measures can detect differences between subjects with Parkinsons disease and healthy controls (HCs). Approach. A method based on a diagram of entropy versus complexity, named complexity–entropy plane, was used to re-analyse a dataset of cerebral haemodynamic signals from subjects with Parkinsons disease and HCs obtained under poikilocapnic conditions. A probability distribution for a set of ordinal patterns, designed to capture regularities in a time series, was computed from each signal under analysis. Four types of entropy and ten types of complexity measures were estimated from these distributions. Mean values of entropy and complexity were compared and their classification power was assessed by evaluating the best linear separator on the corresponding complexity–entropy planes. Main results. Few linear separators obtained significantly better classification, evaluated as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, than signal mean values. However, significant differences in both entropy and complexity were detected between the groups of participants. Significance. Measures of entropy and complexity were able to detect differences between healthy volunteers and subjects with Parkinson’s disease, in poikilocapnic conditions, even though only short recordings were available for analysis. Further work is needed to refine this promising approach, and to help understand the findings in the context of specific pathophysiological changes. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine;Probability distributions- Biomedical signal- Cerebral haemodynamics- Complexity measures- Complexity–entropy causality plane- Disequilibrium- Disorder- Entropy measure- Hemodynamic signals- Idiopathic parkinson’s disease- Statistical complexity- Entropy- entropy- hemodynamics- human- Parkinson disease- receiver operating characteristic- signal processing- Entropy- Hemodynamics- Humans- Parkinson Disease- ROC Curve- Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;English;Article

Music is one of the most sublime stimuli that human beings can experience. Despite being just an acoustic wave that exerts little physical influence on a subject, it triggers profound changes in emotions and physiological states. This study explores the possibility of detecting subtle changes in cerebral blood flow velocity in response to emotional reactions produced by different musical stimuli using multiscale entropy analysis. Approach. Cerebral blood flow signals were successfully recorded for 16 subjects while performing five different musical tasks. The entropy of each signal was estimated using multiscale sample entropy. Main results. This method has been shown to be capable of revealing the complexity of the internal dynamics of different physiological systems, which cannot be appreciated with classic approaches based on entropy on a single scale. Significance. Significant differences in entropy were found between two of the tasks, which suggests that intense cognitive activities with emotional content cause a decrease in the entropy of cerebral haemodynamics. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;Blood- Flow velocity- Hemodynamics- Music- Acoustics waves- Cerebral blood flow- Cerebral blood flow velocities- Emotional reactions- Flow entropy- Haemodynamics- Human being- Multiscale entropy- Physiological state- Sample entropy- Entropy- brain circulation- emotion- entropy- hearing- human- music- Auditory Perception- Cerebrovascular Circulation- Emotions- Entropy- Humans- Music;English;Article

Cerebral blood flow velocity and arterial blood pressure signals of 30 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 30 healthy subjects were obtained non-invasively. Although different machine learning models have been tested with successful results in many cases of clinical interest, there is emerging evidence that complexity and entropy analysis of biomedical signals can detect underlying changes in physiology which relates to diseases. In many studies, both paradigms have been proved in high accuracy in discriminating between health and disease. In this current work a SVM model and two Complexity-Entropy planes were developed, achieving great power in discriminating health from TBI patients, with an AUC of 0.89 for the machine learning approach, and a highest 0.94 AUC by one of the Complexity-Entropy planes. There are almost no cases that compare these two paradigms, which makes it of great interest to put them side by side and discuss their contributions and particularities. © 2021 IEEE.;Biomedical signal processing- Blood- Blood pressure- Brain- Flow velocity- Hemodynamics- Signal analysis- Support vector machines- Cerebral blood flow velocities- Cerebral haemodynamics- Complexity theory- Complexity-entropy causality plane- Hemodynamic signals- Machine learning techniques- Physiological state- Signals analysis- Support vectors machine- Traumatic Brain Injuries- Entropy;English;Conference Paper

This neurodegenerative syndrome affects cognition, memory, behavior, and the visual system, particularly the retina. Objective: This work aims to determine whether the 5xFAD mouse, a transgenic model of AD, displays changes in the function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and if those alterations are correlated with changes in the expression of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitters. Methods: In young (2-3-month-old) and adult (6-7-month-old) 5xFAD and WT mice, we have studied the physiological response, firing rate, and burst of RGCs to various types of visual stimuli using a multielectrode array system. Results: The firing rate and burst response in 5xFAD RGCs showed hyperactivity at the early stage of AD in young mice, whereas hypoactivity was seen at the later stage of AD in adults. The physiological alterations observed in 5xFAD correlate well with an increase in the expression of glutamate in the ganglion cell layer in young and adults. GABA staining increased in the inner nuclear and plexiform layer, which was more pronounced in the adult than the young 5xFAD retina, altering the excitation/inhibition balance, which could explain the observed early hyperactivity and later hypoactivity in RGC physiology. Conclusion: These findings indicate functional changes may be caused by neurochemical alterations of the retina starting at an early stage of the AD disease. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Copper prices follow a time series that is nonlinear and non-stationary, and that has periods that change as a result of potential growth, cyclical fluctuation and errors. Sometimes, the trend and cyclical components together are referred to as a trend-cycle. In order to make predictions, it is necessary to consider the different characteristics of a trend-cycle. In this paper, we study a copper price prediction method using support vector regression (SVR). This work explores the potential of the SVR with external recurrences to make predictions at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 days into the future in the copper closing price at the London Metal Exchange. The best model for each forecast interval is performed using a grid search and balanced cross-validation. In experiments on real data sets, our results obtained indicate that the parameters (C, ε, γ) of the model support vector regression do not differ between the different prediction intervals. Additionally, the amount of preceding values used to make the estimates does not vary according to the predicted interval. Results show that the support vector regression model has a lower prediction error and is more robust. Our results show that the presented model is able to predict copper price volatilities near reality, as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was equal to or less than the 2.2% for prediction periods of 5 and 10 days. © 2020 by the authors.;;English;Article

Detecting nausea before emesis (vomiting) is particularly important for patients who are still unconscious after surgery, because emesis may cause various life-threatening complications. Electrogastrography (EGG) is the cutaneous measurement of the electrical activity of the stomach sensed by electrodes placed on the abdomen of the patient. As the relationship between nausea and gastric dysrhythmias is not yet well understood, the study of electrogastrograms may generate information to relate these processes. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of detecting the presence of nausea in chemotherapy patients. The method consists of acquiring signals using multichannel electrogastrograms, isolating the gastric motion information applying independent component analysis, and then processing the resulting signal to discriminate between normal function and nausea. Feature extraction, clustering, and selection yielded a classifier that discriminated between both classes. The performance of the classifiers was compared among different experiments which include the number of channels and the period of nausea observation (pre- and post-detection). The best classifier obtained 83.33% of accuracy discriminating 31 control and 29 nausea events, using only 4 EGG channels and 3 features: the dominant power, the dominant frequency, and the relationship between the maximum and the average power of the event. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;English;Book Chapter

Data were analyzed from the 2nd CARNet bootstrap initiative, where mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and end tidal CO2 were measured twice in 75 healthy subjects. DCA was analyzed by 14 different centers with a variety of different analysis methods. Intraclass Correlation (ICC) values increased significantly when subjects with low power spectral density MABP (PSD-MABP) values were removed from the analysis for all gain, phase and autoregulation index (ARI) parameters. Gain in the low frequency band (LF) had the highest ICC, followed by phase LF and gain in the very low frequency band. No significant differences were found between analysis methods for gain parameters, but for phase and ARI parameters, significant differences between the analysis methods were found. Alternatively, the Spearman-Brown prediction formula indicated that prolongation of the measurement duration up to 35 minutes may be needed to achieve good reproducibility for some DCA parameters. We conclude that poor DCA reproducibility (ICC&lt-0.4) can improve to good (ICC &gt- 0.6) values when cases with low PSD-MABP are removed, and probably also when measurement duration is increased. © 2020 Elting et al.

Reusable respirators include filters that protect workers against harmful dust, smoke, gases, and vapors. These hazards may cause cancer, lung impairment, and diseases. Respiratory protection is prone to failure or misuse, such as wearing respirators with filters out of service life and employees wearing respirators loosely. Currently, there are no commercial systems capable of reliably alerting of misuse of respiratory protective equipment during the workday shifts or provide early information about dangerous clogging levels of filters. This paper proposes a low energy and non-obtrusive functional building block with embedded electronics that enable breathing monitoring inside an industrial reusable respirator. The embedded electronic device collects multidimensional data from an integrated pressure, temperature, and relative humidity sensor inside a reusable industrial respirator in real time and sends it wirelessly to an external platform for further processing. Here, the calculation of instantaneous breathing rate and estimation of the filter's respirator fitting and clogging level is performed. The device was tested with ten healthy subjects in laboratory trials. The subjects were asked to wear industrial reusable respirator with the embedded electronic device attached inside. The signals measured with the system were compared with airflow signals measured with calibrated transducers for validation purposes. The correlation between the estimated breathing rates using pressure, temperature, and relative humidity with the reference signal (airflow) is 0.987, 0.988 and 0.989 respectively, showing that instantaneous breathing rate can be calculated accurately using the information from the embedded device. Moreover, respirator fitting (well-fitted or loose condition) and filter's clogging levels (≤60%, 80% and 100% clogging) also can be estimated using features extracted from absolute pressure measurements combined to statistical analysis ANOVA models. These experimental outputs represent promising results for further development of data-driven prediction models using machine learning techniques to determine filters end-of-service life. Furthermore, the proposed system would collect relevant data for real-time monitoring of workers' breathing conditions and respirator usage, helping to improve occupational safety and health in the workplace.;breathing- electronics- gas- gas mask- human- Electronics- Gases- Humans- Respiration- Respiratory Protective Devices;English;Article

Estación Central, Santiago, 9170124, Chile- The Cardiovascular Sciences Department, University of Leicester, United Kingdom- Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester, United Kingdom- Informatics Engineering Department, Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Chile;Objective: The capacity of discriminating between normal and impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), based on spontaneous fluctuations in arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), has considerable clinical relevance. This study aimed to quantify the separate contributions of vascular resistance and compliance as parameters that could reflect myogenic and metabolic mechanisms to dCA. Methods: Forty-five subjects were studied under normo and hypercapnic conditions induced by breathing a mixture of 5% carbon dioxide in air. Dynamic cerebrovascular resistance and compliance models with ABP as input and CBFV as output were fitted using Genetic Algorithms to identify parameter values for each subject, and respiratory condition. Results: The efficiency of dCA was assessed from the model's generated CBFV response to an ABP step change, corresponding to an autoregulation index of 5.56 ± 1.57 in normocapnia and 2.38 ± 1.73 in hypercapnia, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9 between both conditions. Vascular compliance increased from 0.75 ± 0.7 ml/mmHg in normocapnia to 5.82 ± 12.0 ml/mmHg during hypercapnia, with an AUC of 0.88. Conclusion: Further work is needed to validate this approach in clinical applications where individualised model parameters could provide relevant diagnostic and prognostic information about dCA impairment. © 2012 IEEE.;Blood- Blood pressure- Carbon dioxide- Hemodynamics- Parameter estimation- Area under the ROC curve- Arterial blood pressure- Arterial compliance- Cerebral autoregulation- Clinical application- Identification of model- Metabolic mechanism- Vascular compliance- Genetic algorithms- carbon dioxide- adult- air- arterial pressure- artery compliance- artery resistance- Article- autoregulation- blood flow velocity- bootstrapping- brain blood flow- breathing- correlation coefficient- dynamic cerebral autoregulation- genetic algorithm- hemodynamics- human- human experiment- hypercapnia- intermethod comparison- mean squared error- measurement accuracy- metabolism- muscle development- process optimization- receiver operating characteristic- reproducibility- sensitivity analysis- support vector machine- algorithm- blood pressure- brain circulation- homeostasis- hypercapnia- Algorithms- Blood Flow Velocity- Blood Pressure- Cerebrovascular Circulation- Homeostasis- Humans- Hypercapnia;English;Article

This neurodegenerative syndrome affects cognition, memory, behavior, and the visual system, particularly the retina. Objective: This work aims to determine whether the 5xFAD mouse, a transgenic model of AD, displays changes in the function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and if those alterations are correlated with changes in the expression of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitters. Methods: In young (2-3-month-old) and adult (6-7-month-old) 5xFAD and WT mice, we have studied the physiological response, firing rate, and burst of RGCs to various types of visual stimuli using a multielectrode array system. Results: The firing rate and burst response in 5xFAD RGCs showed hyperactivity at the early stage of AD in young mice, whereas hypoactivity was seen at the later stage of AD in adults. The physiological alterations observed in 5xFAD correlate well with an increase in the expression of glutamate in the ganglion cell layer in young and adults. GABA staining increased in the inner nuclear and plexiform layer, which was more pronounced in the adult than the young 5xFAD retina, altering the excitation/inhibition balance, which could explain the observed early hyperactivity and later hypoactivity in RGC physiology. Conclusion: These findings indicate functional changes may be caused by neurochemical alterations of the retina starting at an early stage of the AD disease. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Despite the extensive research and the implementation of various models to identify dropout causes and risk groups, few of them have been carried out in the Chilean higher education context.Our work attempts to identify, using machine learning methods, the variables with highest predictive value for student dropout by the end of the first year of study, within a 6-year Informatics Engineering programme with a rather high dropout rate of 21.9% reported on 2018. In that regard, we use the data of 4 cohorts of students (2012-2016) enrolled at the programme, to feed a random forest feature selection process. We later build a decision tree using the identified relevant features, which we later test using data of the 2017-2018 cohorts of students.Despite the fact that the decision tree is over-fitted (97,21% training accuracy against 81.01% test accuracy), the process sheds light on the nature of the variables that determine whether or not a student remains at the end of their first year of study at the University. 6 of the identified factors are academic, and the remaining one is social-cultural. © 2020 IEEE.;Decision trees- Education computing- Engineering research- Informatics- Machine learning- Predictive analytics- First year students- Higher education- Higher education institutions- Machine learning methods- Predictive values- Relevant features- Significant variables- Training accuracy- Students;English;Conference Paper
